Updating
#

latest
version, run:

next

n8n with tunnel
#
Danger
Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.
To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a
tunnel service
that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.
Start n8n with
--tunnel
by running:
1
n8n
start
--tunnel
Reverting an upgrade
#
Install the older version that you want to go back to.
If the upgrade involved a database migration:
Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
Run
n8n db:revert
on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.
Windows troubleshooting
#
If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to
Install NodeJS on Windows
