Binary data
#
Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents.
This page collects resources relating to binary data in n8n.
Working with binary data in your workflows
#
You can process binary data in n8n workflows. n8n provides nodes to help you work with binary data. You can also use code.
Nodes
#
There are three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:
Read/Write Files from Disk
to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
Convert to File
to take input data and output it as a file.
Extract From File
to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.
There are separate nodes for working with XML and HTML data:
HTML
XML
And nodes for performing common tasks:
Compression
Edit Image
FTP
You can trigger a workflow based on changes to a local file using the
Local File trigger
.
To split or concatenate binary data items, use the
data transformation nodes
.
Code
#
You can use the
Code node
to manipulate binary data in your workflows. For example,
Get the binary data buffer
: get the binary data available in your workflow.
Configure binary data mode when self-hosting
#
You can configure how your self-hosted n8n instance handles binary data using the
Binary data environment variables
. This includes tasks such as setting the storage path and choosing how to store binary data.
Your configuration affects how well n8n scales:
Scaling | Binary data filesystem mode
.
Reading and writing binary files can have security implications. If you want to disable reading and writing binary data, use the
NODES_EXCLUDE
environment variable. Refer to
Environment variables | Nodes
for more information.
