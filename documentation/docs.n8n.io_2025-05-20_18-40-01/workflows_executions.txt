Executions
#
An execution is a single run of a workflow.
Execution modes
#
There are two execution modes:
Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select
Test Workflow
to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to
Inactive
while developing and testing.
Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to
Active
.
Execution lists
#
n8n provides two execution lists:
Workflow-level executions
: this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
All executions
: this list shows all executions for all your workflows.
n8n supports
adding custom data to executions
.
