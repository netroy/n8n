Troubleshooting SAML SSO
#
If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:
Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.
For more support, use the
