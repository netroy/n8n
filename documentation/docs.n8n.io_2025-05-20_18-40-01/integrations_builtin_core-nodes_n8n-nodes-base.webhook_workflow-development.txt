Workflow development
#
The
Webhook node
works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.
n8n generates two
Webhook URLs
for each Webhook node: a
Test URL
and a
Production URL
.
Build and test workflows
#
While building or testing a workflow, use the
Test
webhook URL.
Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select
Listen for test event
to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.
When using the Webhook node on localhost on a
self-hosted
n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:
npm with tunnel
Docker with tunnel
Production workflows
#
When your workflow is ready, switch to using the
Production
webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.
When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.
Refer to
Create a workflow
for more information on activating workflows.
