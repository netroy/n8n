Scaling n8n
#
When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.
n8n can run in different
modes
depending on your needs. The
queue
mode provides the best scalability. Refer to
Queue mode
for configuration details.
You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to
Execution data
for details.
