Workflow 1: Merging data
#
Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.
To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:
Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:
Use the
Airtable node
to list the data in the Airtable table named
customers
.
Use the
HTTP Request node
to get data from the REST Countries API:
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
Use the
Merge node
to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as
customerCountry
in Airtable and
name.common
in the Countries API, respectively.
Use another Airtable node to update the fields
region
and
subregion
in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.
The workflow should look like this:
