Compare Datasets
#
The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.
Node parameters
#
Decide which fields to compare. In
Input A Field
, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In
Input B Field
, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
Optional
: You can compare by multiple fields. Select
Add Fields to Match
to set up more comparisons.
Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In
When There Are Differences
, select one of the following:
Use Input A Version
to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
Use Input B Version
to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
Use a Mix of Versions
to use different inputs for different fields.
Use
Prefer
to select either
Input A Version
or
Input B Version
as the main source of truth.
Enter input fields that are exceptions to
For Everything Except
to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
Include Both Versions
to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
Decide whether to use
Fuzzy Compare
. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string
3
are treated as the same with
Fuzzy Compare
turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.
Understand item comparison
#
Item comparison is a two stage process:
n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.
Node options
#
Use the node
Options
to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.
Fields to Skip Comparing
#
Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.
For example, if you compare the two datasets below using
person.language
as the
Fields to Match
, n8n returns them as different. If you add
person.name
to
Fields to Skip Comparing
, n8n returns them as matching.

Disable Dot Notation
#
Whether to disallow referencing child fields using
parent.child
in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).
Multiple Matches
#
Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is
Include All Matches
. You can choose
Include First Match Only
.

n8n returns three items in the
Same Branch
tab. The data is the same in both branches.
If you select
Include First Match Only
, n8n returns two items, in the
Same Branch
tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.
Understand the output
#
There are four output options:
In A only Branch
: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
Same Branch
: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
Different Branch
: Contains data that's different between inputs.
In B only Branch
: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.
