Using OAuth2
#
Note for n8n Cloud users
Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select
Connect my account
to connect through your browser.
Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to
Service-specific settings
for more guidance on those services.
For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:
Register an application
with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
Generate a client secret
for that application.
Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to
Microsoft authentication and authorization basics
.
Register an application
#
Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:
Open the
Microsoft Application Registration Portal
.
Select
Register an application
.
Enter a
Name
for your app.
In
Supported account types
, select
Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)
.

field.
Select
Select a platform
>
Web
.
Select
Register
to finish creating your application.
Copy the
Application (client) ID
and paste it into n8n as the
Client ID
.
Refer to
Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform
for more information.
Generate a client secret
#
With your application created, generate a client secret for it:
On your Microsoft application page, select
Certificates & secrets
in the left navigation.
In
Client secrets
, select
+ New client secret
.
Enter a
Description
for your client secret, such as
n8n credential
.
Select
Add
.
Copy the
Secret
in the
Value
column.
Paste it into n8n as the
Client Secret
.
If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to
Service-specific settings
below for guidance on completing those fields.
Select
Connect my account
in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.
Refer to Microsoft's
Add credentials
for more information on adding a client secret.
Service-specific settings
#
The following services require extra information for OAuth2:
Dynamics
#
Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:
Enter your Dynamics
Domain
.
Select the Dynamics data center
Region
you're within.
Refer to the
Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation
for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.
Microsoft (general)
#
The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of
Scope
s for this credential.
Refer to
Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform
for a list of possible scopes.
Outlook
#
Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:
Turn on
Use Shared Inbox
.
Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the
User Principal Name
.
SharePoint
#
SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint
Subdomain
.
To complete the credential, enter the
Subdomain
part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is
https://tenant123.sharepoint.com
, the subdomain is
tenant123
.
Common issues
#
Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.
Need admin approval
#
When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.
This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.
The procedure for this is covered in the
Microsoft Entra documentation
.
