Using tools with OpenAI assistants

Some operations allow you to connect tools.
Tools
act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.
Select the
Tools
connector to browse the available tools and add them.
Once you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a
root node
, allowing it to form a
cluster node
with the tools
sub-nodes
. See
Node types
for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.
