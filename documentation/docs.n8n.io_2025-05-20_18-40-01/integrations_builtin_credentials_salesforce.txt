Your
Environment Type
(Production or Sandbox)
A
Client ID
: Generated when you create a connected app.
Your Salesforce

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:
In n8n, select the
Environment Type
for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from
Production
or
Sandbox
.
Enter your Salesforce
Username
.
Log in to your org in Salesforce.
You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce

for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
From
