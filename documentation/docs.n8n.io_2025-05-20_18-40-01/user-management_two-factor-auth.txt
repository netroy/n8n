Two-factor authentication (2FA)
#
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.
Enable 2FA
#
You need an authenticator app on your phone.
To enable 2FA in n8n:
Go to you
Settings
>
Personal
.
Select
Enable 2FA
. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
Enter the code from your app in
Code from authenticator app
.
Select
Continue
. n8n displays recovery codes.
Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.
Disable 2FA for your instance
#
Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting
N8N_MFA_ENABLED
to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to
Configuration methods
for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.
