Create a workflow
#
A
workflow
is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the
workflow canvas
.
Create a workflow
#
Select the
button
in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your
personal space
or a specific
project
you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
Get started by adding a trigger node: select
Add first step...
Or:
Select the
create
button in the upper-right corner from either the
Overview
page or a specific
project
. Select workflow.
If you're doing this from the
Overview
page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
Get started by adding a trigger node: select
Add first step...
If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the
quickstart guides
to quickly try out n8n features.
Run workflows manually
#
You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.
To run manually, select
Test Workflow
.
Run workflows automatically
#
All new workflows are inactive by default.
You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.
To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle
Inactive
/
Active
.
Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.
