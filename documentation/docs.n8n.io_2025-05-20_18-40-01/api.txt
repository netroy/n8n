The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:
KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs
: a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)
: this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?
: more detailed information about REST APIs.
MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP
: REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.
Use the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)
Trying out the API in the
playground
can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.
