#
You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:
S3
Prerequisites

DigitalOcean Spaces
MinIO
Wasabi
Supported authentication methods
#
S3 endpoint
Related resources
#
Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to
Wasabi's REST API documentation
or
DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation
.
Using S3 endpoint
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
An
S3 Endpoint
: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
A
Region
: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the "region slug."
An
Access Key ID
: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
A
Secret Access Key
: Enter the secret access key for the
Access Key ID
.
Force Path Style
: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
Ignore SSL Issues
: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information.
Using DigitalOcean Spaces
#
To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:
In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open
Settings
. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend
https://
to that endpoint and enter it as the
S3 Endpoint
in n8n.
Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
For the
Region
, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example,
nyc3
.
If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter
us-east-1
instead.
From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to
API
.
Open the
Spaces Keys
tab.
Select
Generate New Key
.
Enter a
Name
for your key, like
n8n integration
and select the checkmark.
Copy the
Key
displayed next to the name and enter this as the
Access Key ID
in n8n.
Copy the
Secret
value and enter this as the
Secret Access Key
in n8n.
Refer to
Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys
for more information on generating the key and secret.
Keep the
Force Path Style
toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of
Ignore SSL Issues
turned off.
To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on
Ignore SSL Issues
.
Refer to DigitalOcean's
Spaces API Reference Documentation
for more information.
Using Wasabi
#
To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:
For the
S3 Endpoint
, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with
https://
.
Refer to
What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?
to identify the correct URL.
For the
Region
, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered
https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com
as the
S3 Endpoint
,
us-east-2
is the region.
Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
Open the
Menu
and select
Access Keys
.
Select
CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY
.
Select whether the key is for the
Root User
or a
Sub-User
and select
CREATE
.
Copy the
Access Key
and enter it in n8n as the
Access Key ID
.
Copy the
Secret Key
and enter it in n8n as the
Secret Access Key
.
Refer to
Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set
for more information on generating the key and secret.
Wasabi recommends turning on the
Force Path Style
toggle "because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues." Refer to the Wasabi
REST API Introduction
for more information.
Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of
Ignore SSL Issues
turned off.
To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on
Ignore SSL Issues
