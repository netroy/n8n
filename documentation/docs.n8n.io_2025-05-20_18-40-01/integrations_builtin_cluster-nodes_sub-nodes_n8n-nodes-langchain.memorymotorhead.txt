Motorhead node
#
Use the Motorhead node to use Motorhead as a
memory
server.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Motorhead node supports, and links to more resources.

Session ID
: Enter the ID to use to store the memory in the workflow data.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes
Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.
Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five
name
values, the expression
{{ $json.name }}
resolves to each name in turn.
In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five
name
values, the expression
{{ $json.name }}
always resolves to the first name.

Single memory instance
#
If you add more than one Motorhead node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the
Chat Memory Manager
node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

: Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
hallucinations
: Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
