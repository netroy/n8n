Refer to
Linear's API documentation
for more information about the service.
Using API key
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A personal
API Key
: Create an API key in your
Settings > API
. Refer to the
Linear Personal API keys documentation
for more information.
Using OAuth2
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A
Client ID
: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.
A
Client Secret
: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.
Select the
Actor
: The actor defines how the OAuth2 application should create issues, comments and other changes. Options include:
User
(Linear's default): The application creates resources as the authorizing user. Use this option if you want each user to do their own authentication.
Application
: The application creates resources as itself. Use this option if you have only one user (like an admin) authorizing the application.
To use this credential with the
Linear Trigger
node, you must enable the
Include Admin Scope
toggle.
Refer to the
Linear OAuth2 Authentication documentation
for more detailed instructions and explanations. Use the n8n
OAuth Redirect URL
as the
Redirect callback URL
in your Linear OAuth2 application.
