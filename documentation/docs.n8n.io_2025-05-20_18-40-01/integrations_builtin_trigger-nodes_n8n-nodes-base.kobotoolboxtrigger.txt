KoboToolbox Trigger node
#
KoboToolbox
is a field survey and data collection tool to design interactive forms to be completed offline from mobile devices. It's available both as a free cloud solution or as a self-hosted version.

Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's
KoboToolbox Trigger integrations
page.
This node starts a workflow upon new submissions of a specified form. The trigger node handles the creation/deletion of the hook, so you don't need to do any setup in KoboToolbox.
It works the same way as the Get Submission operation in the
KoboToolbox
node, including supporting the same reformatting options.
