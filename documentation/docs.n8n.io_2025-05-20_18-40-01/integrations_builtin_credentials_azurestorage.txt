Common issues
#
Here are the known common errors and issues with Azure Storage credentials.
Need admin approval
#
When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.
This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.
The procedure for this is covered in the
Microsoft Entra documentation
