Disable the public REST API

The
n8n public REST API
allows you to programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the n8n GUI.
If you don't plan on using this API, n8n recommends disabling it to improve the security of your n8n installation.

public REST API
, set the
N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED
environment variable to
true
, for example:
1
export
N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED
=
true
