API pagination
#
The default page size is 100 results. You can change the page size limit. The maximum permitted size is 250.
When a response contains more than one page, it includes a cursor, which you can use to request the next pages.
For example, say you want to get all active workflows, 150 at a time.
Get the first page:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
# For a self-hosted n8n instance
curl
-X
'GET'
\
'<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150'
\
-H
'accept: application/json'
\
-H
'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
# For n8n Cloud
curl
-X
'GET'
\
'<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true&limit=150'
\
-H
'accept: application/json'
\
-H
'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
The response is in JSON format, and includes a
nextCursor
value. This is an example response.
