Troubleshooting and errors
#
Error: Missing packages
#
n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.
If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:
Persist the contents of the
~/.n8n/nodes
directory. This is the best option. If you follow the
Docker installation
guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
Set the
N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES
environment variable to
true
.
The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.
Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud
#
If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the
Cloud Admin Panel
>
Manage
and toggle
Disable all community nodes
to
true
. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.
