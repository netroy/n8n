Access Token
An optional

for that app.
Configure the Facebook trigger
.
Optional:
Add an app secret
.
App Review
: Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

mode, refer to

and
Publish | App Types
.
Generate an App Access Token
#
Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:
In a separate tab or window, open the
Graph API explorer
.
Select the
Meta App
you just created in the
Access Token
section.
In
User or Page
, select
Get App Token
.
Select
Generate Access Token
.
The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.
App unavailable
You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.
Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the
Access Token
. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.
Save your n8n credential.
Refer to the Meta instructions for
Your First Request
for more information on generating the token.
Configure the Facebook Trigger
#
Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:
In your Meta app, copy the
App ID
from the top navigation bar.
In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
Paste the
App ID
into the
APP ID
field.
Select
Execute step
to shift the trigger into listening mode.
Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's
Webhooks
product configuration is open.
Subscribe
to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
Copy the
Webhook URL
from n8n and enter it as the
Callback URL
in your Meta App.
Enter the
Access Token
you copied above as the
Verify token
.
Select
Verify and save
. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
Some webhook subscriptions, like
User
, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
You can send some
Test
events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.
Refer to the
Facebook Trigger node
documentation for more information.
Optional: Add an App Secret
#
For added security, Meta recommends adding an
App Secret
. This signs all API calls with the
appsecret_proof
parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.
To generate an App Secret:
In Meta while viewing your app, select
App settings > Basic
from the left menu.
Select
Show
next to the
App secret
field.
The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the
App Secret
.
Save
your n8n credential.
Refer to the
App Secret documentation
for more information.
App review
#
App Review requires Business Verification.
Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:
Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.
If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.
As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.
Refer to Meta's
App Review
and
Advanced Access
documentation for more information.
Common issues
#

#
Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.
Refer to
Limitations | Create an app
if you're over that limit.
