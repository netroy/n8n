Understand workflow history
#
n8n creates a new version when you:
Save your workflow.
Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
Pull from a Git repository using
Source control
. Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.
Workflow history and execution history
Don't confuse workflow history with the
Workflow-level executions list
.
Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to
Debug and re-run past executions
in your current workflow.
Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
