account, and have:
Your
Host
The

A Long-Lived
Access Token
To generate an access token and set up the credential:
To generate your
Access Token
, log in to Home Assistant and open your
User profile
.
In the
Long-Lived Access Tokens
section, generate a new token.
Copy this token and enter it in n8n as your
Access Token
.
Enter the URL or IP address of your Home Assistant
Host
, without the
http://
or
https://
protocol, for example
your.awesome.home
.
For the
Port
, enter the appropriate port:
If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at
http://
, keep the default of
8123
.
If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at
https://
, enter
443
.
If you've configured Home Assistant to use a specific port, enter that port.
If you've enabled SSL in Home Assistant in the
config.yml map key
, turn on the
SSL
toggle in n8n. If you're not sure, it's best to turn this setting on if you access your home assistant UI using
https://
instead of
http://
