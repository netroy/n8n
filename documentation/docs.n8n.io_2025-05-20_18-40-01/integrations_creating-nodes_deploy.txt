Deploy a node
#
This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.
You can choose to:
Submit your node to the community node repository
. This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to
install and use it
like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
Install the node into your n8n instance as a
private node
.
