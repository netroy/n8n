Google Authenticator Secret
for more information.
A
Label
: The identifier for the account. It contains an account name as a URI-encoded string. You can include prefixes to identify the provider or service managing the account. If you use prefixes, use a literal or url-encoded colon to separate the issuer prefix and the account name, for example:
GitHub:john-doe
. Refer to
