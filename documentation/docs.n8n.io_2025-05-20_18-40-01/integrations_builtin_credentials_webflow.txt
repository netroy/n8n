Note for n8n Cloud users
Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select
Connect my account
to connect through your browser.
If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch,
register an application
in your workspace.
Use these settings for your application:
Copy the
OAuth callback URL
from n8n and add it as a
Redirect URI
in your application.
Once you've created your application, copy the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
and enter them in your n8n credential.
If you are using the Webflow Data API V1 (deprecated), enable the
Legacy
toggle. Otherwise, leave this inactive.
Refer to
OAuth
for more information on Webflow's OAuth web flow.
