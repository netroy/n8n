Custom executions data
#
You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the
Execution Data node
. n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.
Feature availability
Custom executions data is available on:
Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community
Available in version 0.222.0 and above.
Set and access custom data using the Code node
#
This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to
Execution Data node
for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.
Set custom executions data
#
Set a single piece of extra data:
JavaScript
Python
1
$execution
.
customData
.
set
(
"key"
,
"value"
);
1
_execution
.
customData
.
set
(
"key"
,
"value"
);
Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:
JavaScript
Python
1
$execution
.
customData
.
setAll
({
"key1"
:
"value1"
,
"key2"
:
"value2"
})
1
_execution
.
customData
.
setAll
({
"key1"
:
"value1"
,
"key2"
:
"value2"
})
There are limitations:
They must be strings
key
has a maximum length of 50 characters
value
has a maximum length of 255 characters
n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data
Access the custom data object during execution
#
You can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:
JavaScript
Python
1
2
3
4
5
// Access the current state of the object during the execution
const
customData
=
$execution
.
customData
.
getAll
();
// Access a specific value set during this execution
const
customData
=
$execution
.
customData
.
get
(
"key"
);
1
2
3
4
5
# Access the current state of the object during the execution
customData
=
_execution
.
customData
.
getAll
();
# Access a specific value set during this execution
customData
=
_execution
.
customData
.
get
(
"key"
);
