Using OAuth2
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A
Client ID
: Generated when you
create a Strava app
.
A
Client Secret
: Generated when you
create a Strava app
.
Use these settings for your Strava app:
In n8n, copy the
OAuth Callback URL
. Paste this URL into your Strava app's
Authorization Callback Domain
.
Remove the protocol (
https://
or
http://
) and the relative URL (
/oauth2/callback
or
/rest/oauth2-credential/callback
) from the
Authorization Callback Domain
. For example, if the OAuth Redirect URL was originally
https://oauth.n8n.cloud/oauth2/callback
, the
Authorization Callback Domain
would be
oauth.n8n.cloud
.
Copy the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
from your app and add them to your n8n credential.
Refer to
