Using instance URL
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
The
Base URL
of your Ollama instance.
The default
Base URL
is
http://localhost:11434
, but if you've set the
OLLAMA_HOST
environment variable, enter that value. If you have issues connecting to a local n8n server, try
127.0.0.1
instead of
localhost
.
Refer to
How do I configure Ollama server?
for more information.
Ollama and self-hosted n8n
#
If you're self-hosting n8n on the same machine as Ollama, you may run into issues if they're running in different containers.
For this setup, open a specific port for n8n to communicate with Ollama by setting the
OLLAMA_ORIGINS
variable or adjusting
OLLAMA_HOST
to an address the other container can access.
Refer to Ollama's
How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?
for more information.
