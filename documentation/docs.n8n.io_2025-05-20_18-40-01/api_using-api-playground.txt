Using the API playground
#
Feature availability
The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.
The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.
n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:
1
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs
The API version number is
1
. There may be multiple versions available in the future.
Real data
If you select
Authorize
and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.
The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the
credentials
endpoint:
1
N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/
{
credentialTypeName
}
How to find
credentialTypeName
To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the
{credentialTypeName}
is
googleDriveOAuth2Api
:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
{
...
,
"credentials"
:
{
"googleDriveOAuth2Api"
:
{
"id"
:
"9"
,
"name"
:
"Google Drive"
}
}
}
