If

Use the If node to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

Conditions
for your If node.
Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to filter for dates after a particular date, select
Date & Time > is after
.
The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to
Available data type comparisons
for a full list of all comparisons by data type.

Add condition
to create more conditions.

#
You can choose to keep data:
When it meets all conditions: Create two or more conditions and select
AND
in the dropdown between them.
When it meets any of the conditions: Create two or more conditions and select
OR
in the dropdown between them.

Branch execution with If and Merge nodes
#
0.236.0 and below
n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the
v0 (legacy)
workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your
workflow settings
.
If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.
One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.
For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the
true
output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the
false
data stream.
