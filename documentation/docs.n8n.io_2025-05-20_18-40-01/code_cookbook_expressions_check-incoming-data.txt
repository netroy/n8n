Check incoming data
#
At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return
not found
if the variable is empty.
1
{{
$json
[
"variable_name"
]
?
$json
[
"variable_name"
]
:
"not found"
}}
The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator
here
.
As an alternative, you can use the
nullish coalescing operator (??)
or the
logical or operator (||)
:
1
2
{{
$x
??
"default value"
}}
{{
$x
||
"default value"
}}
In either of the above two cases, the value of
$x
will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string
default value
is the fallback value.
