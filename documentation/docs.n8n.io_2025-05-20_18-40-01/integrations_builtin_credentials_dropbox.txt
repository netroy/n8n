Dropbox credentials
#
You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:
Dropbox
Supported authentication methods
#
API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.
App reuse
You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.
