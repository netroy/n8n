Discord node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Discord node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Add extra fields to embeds
#
Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.
The Discord node supports embeds when using the
Send
operation on the
Message
resource. Select
Add Embeds
to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.
To add fields that aren't included by default, set
Input Method
to
Raw JSON
. From here, add a JSON object to the
Value
parameter defining the
field names
and values you want to include.
For example, to include
footer
and
fields
, neither of which are available using the
Enter Fields
Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

{
"author"
:
"My Name"
,
"url"
:
"https://discord.js.org"
,
"fields"
:
[
{
"name"
:
"Regular field title"
,
"value"
:
"Some value here"
}
],
"footer"
:
{
"text"
:
"Some footer text here"
,
"icon_url"
:

}
}
You can learn more about embeds in
Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord
.
If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the
HTTP Request
with your existing Discord credentials to
POST
to the following URL:
1
https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages
In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

Mention users and channels
#
To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to
Discord's message formatting guidelines
.
To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.
You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in
Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs
.
Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:
User
:
<@USER_ID>
Channel
:
<#CHANNEL_ID>
Role
:
<@&ROLE_ID>
