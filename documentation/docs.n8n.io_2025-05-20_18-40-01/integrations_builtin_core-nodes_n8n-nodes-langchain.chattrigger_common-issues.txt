Chat Trigger node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Chat Trigger node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node
#
When
embedding
the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.
To do this, use the
metadata
field in the JSON object you pass to the
createChat
function in your embedded chat window:
1
2
3
4
5
6
createChat
({
webhookUrl
:
'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL'
,
metadata
:
{
'YOUR_KEY'
:
'YOUR_DATA'
};
});
The
metadata
field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using    n8n's
data processing features
.
Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages
#
When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a
workflow could not be started!
error.
In Chat Triggers, the
Load Previous Session
option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the
sessionID
. When you set the
Load Previous Session
option to
From memory
, it's almost always best to
connect the same memory node
to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:
In your
Chat Trigger
node, set the
Load Previous Session
option to
From Memory
. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
Attach a
Simple Memory
node to the
Memory
connector.
Attach the same
Simple Memory
node to
Memory
connector of your
Agent
.
In the
Simple Memory
node, set
Session ID
to
Connected Chat Trigger Node
.
One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the
Session ID
in your memory node to
Define below
.
If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.
