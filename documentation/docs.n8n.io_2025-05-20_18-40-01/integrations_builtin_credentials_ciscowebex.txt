Note for n8n Cloud users
You'll only need to enter the Credentials Name and select the
Connect my account
button in the OAuth credential to connect your Webex by Cisco account to n8n.
Should you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need to create an integration to use this credential. Refer to the instructions in the
Webex Registering your Integration documentation
to begin.
