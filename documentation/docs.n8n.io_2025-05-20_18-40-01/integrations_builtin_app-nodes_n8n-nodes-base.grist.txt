Get the Row ID
#
To update or delete a particular record, you need the Row ID. There are two ways to get the Row ID:
Create a Row ID column in Grist
Create a new column in your Grist table with the formula
$id
.
Use the Get All operation
The
Get All
operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.
You can get it with the expression
{{$node["GristNodeName"].json["id"]}}
.
Filter records when using the Get All operation
#
Select
Add Option
and select
Filter
from the dropdown list.
You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.
For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas. The result will include records which match any of the values for that column.
