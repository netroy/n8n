Not seeing the
Personal Access Tokens
option has two possible causes:
Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.
You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.
To identify the root cause and resolve it:
Log in to Mattermost as an admin.
Go to
System Console > Integrations > Integration Management
.
Confirm that
Enable personal access tokens
is set to
true
. If it's not, change.
Go to
System Console > User Management > Users
.
Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.
Select the
Actions
dropdown for the user and select
Manage roles
.
Check the box for
Allow this account to generate personal access tokens
and
Save
.
Refer to the Mattermost
Personal access tokens documentation
for more information.
