How to submit a post
#
n8n appreciates all contributions. Publishing a tutorial on your own site that supports the community is a great contribution. If you want n8n to highlight your post on the blog, follow these steps:
Email your idea to
marketing@n8n.io
with the subject "Blog contribution: [Your Topic]."
Submit your draft:
Write your post in a Google Doc following the
style guide
.
If your blog post includes example workflows, include the workflow JSON in a separate section at the end.
For author credit, provide a second Google Doc with your full name, a short byline, and your image. n8n will use this to create your author page and credit you as the author of the post.
Wait for feedback. We will respond if your draft fits with the blog's strategy and requirements. If you don't hear back within 30 days, it means we won't be moving forward with your blog post.
Refer a candidate
#
Do you know someone who would be a great fit for one of our
open positions
? Refer them to us! In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period.
Here's how this works:
Search
: Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit.
Referral
: Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to
Jobs at n8n
with the subject line
Employee referral - [job title]
and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our
careers page
.
Evaluation
: We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process.
Reward
: As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account.
