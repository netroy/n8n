Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy
#
n8n creates the webhook URL by combining
N8N_PROTOCOL
,
N8N_HOST
and
N8N_PORT
. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.
