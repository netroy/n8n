Google Sheets Sheet Within Document operations
#
Use this operation to create, update, clear or delete a sheet in a Google spreadsheet from Google Sheets. Refer to
Google Sheets
for more information on the Google Sheets node itself.
This node can be used as an AI tool
This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the
AI tool parameters documentation
.
Append or Update Row

to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list,
By URL
to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or
By ID
to enter the
spreadsheetId
.

Mapping Column Mode
:
Map Each Column Manually
: Enter
Values to Send
for each column.
Map Automatically
: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an
Edit Fields
node before this node to change them if required.)
Nothing
: Don't map any data.
Options
#
Cell Format
: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to
Google Sheets API | CellFormat
for more information.
Let Google Sheets format
(default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings.
Let n8n format
: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.
Data Location on Sheet
: Use this option when you need to specify the data range on your sheet.
Header Row
: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.
First Data Row
: Specify the row index where the actual data starts.
Handling extra fields in input
: When using
Mapping Column Mode > Map Automatically
, use this option to decide how to handle fields in the input data that don't match any existing columns in the sheet.
Insert in New Column(s)
(default): Adds new columns for any extra data.
Ignore Them
: Ignores extra data that don't match the existing columns.
Error
: Throws an error and stops execution.
Use Append
: Turn on this option to use the
Google API append endpoint
for adding new data rows.
By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.
Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps.
Refer to the
Method: spreadsheets.values.update | Google Sheets
API documentation for more information.
