Database structure
#
This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.
Database and query technology
#
By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.
n8n uses
TypeORM
for queries and migrations.
To inspect the n8n database, you can use
DBeaver
, which is an open-source universal database tool.
