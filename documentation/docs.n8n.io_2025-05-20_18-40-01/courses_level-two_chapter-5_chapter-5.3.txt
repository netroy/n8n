Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors
#
Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.
To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:
Create a new workflow.
Add an
Error Trigger node
(and execute it as a test).
Connect a
Discord node
to the
Error Trigger node
and configure these fields:
Webhook URL
: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.
Text
: "The workflow
{workflow name}
failed, with the error message:
{execution error message}
. Last node executed:
{name of the last executed node}
. Check this workflow execution here:
{execution URL}
My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.
Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets
{}
with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.
Execute the Discord node.
Set the newly created workflow as the
Error Workflow
for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.
The workflow should look like this:
