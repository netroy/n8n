Set up SSL
#
There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.
Use a reverse proxy (recommended)
#
Use a reverse proxy like
Traefik
or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.
Refer to
Security | Data encryption
for more information.
Pass certificates into n8n directly
#
You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the
N8N_SSL_CERT
and
N8N_SSL_KEY
environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.
You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.
Refer to
Deployment environment variables
for more information on these variables and
Configuration
for more information on setting environment variables.
