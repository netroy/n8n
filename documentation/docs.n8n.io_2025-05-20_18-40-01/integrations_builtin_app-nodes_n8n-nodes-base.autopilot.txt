Autopilot node
#
Use the Autopilot node to automate work in Autopilot, and integrate Autopilot with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Autopilot features, including creating, deleting, and updating contacts, as well as adding contacts to a list.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Autopilot node supports and links to more resources.
Autopilot branding change
Autopilot has become Ortto. The Autopilot credentials and nodes are only compatible with Autopilot, not the new Ortto API.
Credentials
