Google: OAuth2 generic
#
This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with
custom operations
.
Note for n8n Cloud users
For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting
Sign in with Google
in the OAuth section:
Google Calendar
Google Contacts
Google Drive
Google Mail
Google Sheets
Google Sheets Trigger
Google Tasks
Prerequisites
#
Create a
Google Cloud
account.
Set up OAuth
#
There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:
Create a Google Cloud Console project
.
Enable APIs
.
Configure your OAuth consent screen
.
Create your Google OAuth client credentials
.
Finish your n8n credential
.
Create a Google Cloud Console project
#
First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the
next section
:
Log in to your
Google Cloud Console
using your Google credentials.
In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select
New project
or go directly to the
New Project
page.
Enter a
Project name
and select the
Location
for your project.
Select
Create
.
Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.
Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
Enable APIs
#
With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:
Access your
Google Cloud Console - Library
. Make sure you're in the correct project.
Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
Go to
APIs & Services > Library
.
Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.
Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:
Google Perspective:
Request API Access
.
Google Ads: Get a
Developer Token
.
Google Drive API required
The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:
Google Docs
Google Sheets
Google Slides
Google Vertex AI API
In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the
Cloud Resource Manager API
.
Select
ENABLE
.
Configure your OAuth consent screen
#
If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to
configure the OAuth consent screen
:
Access your
Google Cloud Console - Library
. Make sure you're in the correct project.
Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
Open the left navigation menu and go to
APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
.
Select
Get started
to begin configuring OAuth consent.
Enter an
App name
and
User support email
to include on the Oauth screen.
For the
Audience
, select
Internal
for user access within your organization's Google workspace or
External
for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's
User type documentation
for more information on user types.
Select the
Email addresses
Google should use to contact you about changes to your project.
Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy and select
Create
.
In the left-hand menu, select
Branding
.
In the
Authorized domains
section, select
Add domain
:
If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add
n8n.cloud
If you're
self-hosting
, add the domain of your n8n instance.
Select
Save
at the bottom of the page.
Create your Google OAuth client credentials
#
Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:
In the
APIs & Services
section, select
Credentials
.
Select
+ Create credentials
>
OAuth client ID
.
In the
Application type
dropdown, select
Web application
.
Google automatically generates a
Name
. Update the
Name
to something you'll recognize in your console.
From your n8n credential, copy the
OAuth Redirect URL
. Paste it into the
Authorized redirect URIs
in Google Console.
Select
Create
.
Finish your n8n credential
#
With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:
From Google's
OAuth client created
modal, copy the
Client ID
. Enter this in your n8n credential.
From the same Google modal, copy the
Client Secret
. Enter this in your n8n credential.
You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to
Scopes
for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:
1
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
In n8n, select
Sign in with Google
to complete your Google authentication.
Save
your new credentials.

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:
Scopes
#
Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to
OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs
for a list of scopes for all services.
n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the
Supported scopes
list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

Troubleshooting
#
Google hasn't verified this app
#
If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning
Google hasn't verified this app
. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in
Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app
.
Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized
#
For Google Cloud apps with
Publishing status
set to
Testing
and
User type
set to
External
, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to
Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen
for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.
