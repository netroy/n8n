Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app
#
Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances
Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.
Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.

Upgrade a community node
#
Breaking changes in versions
Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can
downgrade
.
Upgrade to the latest version
#
You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in
Settings
>
community nodes
.
When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an
Update
button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.
Upgrade to a specific version
#
To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the
Installation
instructions for more guidance.
Downgrade a community node
#
If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.
To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the
Installation
instructions for more guidance.
