Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate
#
You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.
Available in version 1.42.0
This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.
To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to
/opt/custom-certificates
in the container.
Docker
#
The examples below assume you have a folder called
pki
that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.
Docker CLI
#
When using the CLI you can use the
-v
flag from the command line:
1

docker
run
-it
--rm
\
--name
n8n
\
-p

:5678
\
-v
./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
\

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):
1
docker
exec
--user
0
n8n
chown
-R
1000
:1000
/opt/custom-certificates
