Using community nodes
#
To use community nodes, you first need to
install
them.
Adding community nodes to your workflow
#
After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the
Nodes
panel. n8n marks community nodes with a
Package
icon in the nodes panel.
Community nodes with duplicate names
#
It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.
