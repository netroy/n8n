Google Sheets node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Google Sheets node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Append an array
#
To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.
To do so, consider using:
The
Split Out
node.
The
AI Transform
node. For example, try entering something like:
1
Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.
The
Code node
.
Column names were updated after the node's setup
#
You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.
To refresh the column names, re-select
Mapping Column Mode
. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.
Once the column names refresh, update the node parameters.
