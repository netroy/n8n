HubSpot Trigger node
#
HubSpot
provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages, customer support, and search engine optimization.
Webhooks
If you activate a second trigger, the previous trigger stops working. This is because the trigger registers a new webhook with HubSpot when activated. HubSpot only allows one webhook at a time.
