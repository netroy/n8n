To configure this credential, you'll need:

OAuth Authentication
:
Copy the
OAuth Redirect URL
from n8n and enter it as the
OAuth 2 redirect URL
in Twist.
OAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n
Twist doesn't accept a
localhost
Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example:
https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback
. If your n8n
OAuth Redirect URL
contains localhost, refer below to
Local environment redirect URL
for generating a URL that Twist will allow.
Select
Update OAuth settings
to save those changes.
Copy the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.
Local environment redirect URL
#
Twist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:
Use
ngrok
to expose the local server running on port
5678
to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:
1
ngrok
http
5678
Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace
<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
with the URL that you get from the previous step.
1
export
WEBHOOK_URL
=
<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
Use the generated URL as your
OAuth 2 redirect URL
in Twist.
