Simple Memory node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Simple Memory node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Single memory instance
#
If you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the
Chat Memory Manager
node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.
Managing the Session ID
#
In most cases, the
sessionId
is automatically retrieved from the
On Chat Message
trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase
No sessionId
.
If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a
sessionId
.
If you're not using the
On Chat Message
trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.
For testing purposes, you can use a static key like
my_test_session
. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.
