The very quick quickstart
#
This quickstart gets you started using n8n as quickly as possible. Its allows you to try out the UI and introduces two key features:
workflow templates
and
expressions
. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts in-depth.
In this tutorial, you will:
Load a
workflow
from the workflow templates library
Add a node and configure it using expressions
Run your first workflow
Step one: Sign up for n8n
#
This quickstart uses
n8n Cloud
. A free trial is available for new users. If you haven't already done so,
sign up
for an account now.
Step two: Open a workflow template
#
n8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. You can use this to work with fake data and avoid setting up
credentials
.
Go to
Templates | Very quick quickstart
.
Select
Use workflow
to view the options for using the template.
Select
Import template to
cloud workspace
to load the template into your Cloud instance.
This workflow:
Gets example data from the
Customer Datastore
node.
Uses the
Edit Fields
node to extract only the desired data and assigns that data to variables. In this example, you map the customer name, ID, and description.
The individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called
nodes
. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.
Step three: Run the workflow
#
Select
Test Workflow
. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.
Step four: Add a node
#
Add a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.
Select the
Add node
connector on the Edit Fields node.
Search for
Customer Messenger
. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select
Customer Messenger (n8n training)
to add the node to the
canvas
. n8n opens the node automatically.
Use
expressions
to map in the
Customer ID
and create the
Message
:
In the
INPUT
panel select the
Schema
tab.
Drag
Edit Fields1
>
customer_id
into the
Customer ID
field in the node settings.
Hover over
Message
. Select the
Expression
tab, then select the expand button
to open the full expressions editor.
Copy this expression into the editor:
1
Hi {{ $json.customer_name }}. Your description is: {{ $json.customer_description }}
Close the expressions editor, then close the
Customer Messenger
node by clicking outside the node or selecting
Back to canvas
.
Select
Test Workflow
. n8n runs the workflow.
The complete workflow should look like this:
