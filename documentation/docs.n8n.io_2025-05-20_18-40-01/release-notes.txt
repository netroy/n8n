Faster ways to open sub-workflows
#
We‚Äôve added several new ways to navigate your multi-workflow automations faster.
From any workflow with a sub-workflow node:
üñ±Ô∏è Right-click on a sub-workflow node and select
Open sub-workflow
from the context menu
‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard shortcuts
Windows:
CTRL + SHIFT + O
or
CTRL + Double Click
Mac:
CMD + SHIFT + O
or
CMD + Double Click
These options will bring your sub-workflow up in a new tab.
Archive workflows
#
If you‚Äôve ever accidentally removed a workflow, you‚Äôll appreciate the new archiving feature. Instead of permanently deleting workflows with the Remove action, workflows are now archived by default. This allows you to recover them if needed.
How to:
Archive a workflow
- Select
Archive
from the Editor UI menu. It has replaced the
Remove
action.
Find archived workflows
- Archived workflows are hidden by default. To find your archived workflows, select the option for
Show archived workflows
in the workflow filter menu.
Permanently delete a workflow
- Once a workflow is archived, you can
Delete
it from the  options menu.
Recover a workflow
- Select
Unarchive
from the options menu.
Keep in mind:
Workflows archival requires the same permissions as required previously for removal.
You cannot select archived workflows as sub-workflows to execute
Active workflows are deactivated when they are archived
Archived workflows can not be edited

Partial Execution for AI Tools
#
We‚Äôve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.
Partial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.
Partial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.
How to:
To use this feature you can either:
Click the
Play
button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.
Open the tool‚Äôs
Node Details View
and select
"Test step"
to run it from there.
If you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test.
Insights enhancements for Enterprise
#
Two weeks after the launch of
Insights
, we‚Äôre releasing some enhancements designed for enterprise users.
Expanded time ranges
. You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.
Hourly granularity
. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.
These updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.
Filter insights

Extended HTTP Request tool functionality
#
We‚Äôve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options‚Äîlike Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.
This update also includes support for the
$fromAI
function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt ‚Äî making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.
How to:
Open your AI Agent node in the canvas.
Click the
‚Äò+‚Äô icon
to add a new tool connection.
In the
Tools panel
, select HTTP
Request Tool.
Configure it just like you would a regular
HTTP Request node
‚Äî including advanced options
üëâ Learn more about configuring the
HTTP Request tool
.
Scoped API keys
#
Users on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.
Scoped API keys
Previously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases.  Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.
What‚Äôs new
When creating a new API key, you can now:
Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.
Specify which resources the key can interact with.
Supported scopes include:
Variables ‚Äî list, create, delete
Security audit ‚Äî generate reports
Projects ‚Äî list, create, update, delete
Executions ‚Äî list, read, delete
Credentials ‚Äî list, create, update, delete, move
Workflows ‚Äî list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags
Scoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what‚Äôs needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.
Drag and Drop in Folders
#
Folders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now
drag and drop workflows and folders
‚Äî making it even easier to keep things tidy.
Need to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It‚Äôs a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.
üìÅ Folders are available to all
registered
users‚Äîjump in and get your workspace in order!

Insights
#
We're rolling out
Insights
, a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time. It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements.
In this first release, we‚Äôre introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution.
1. Summary banner
#
A new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.
Insights summary banner
Available metrics:
Total production executions
Total failed executions
Failure rate
Average runtime of all workflows
Estimated time saved
This overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions.
2. Insights dashboard
#
On Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity.
Insights dashboard
The dashboard includes:
Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions
Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics
Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior
Runtime average and failure rate over time
3. Time saved per execution
#
Within workflow settings, you can now assign a ‚Äútime saved per execution‚Äù value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.
This is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities.
Node updates
#
We added a credential check for the Salesforce node
We added SearXNG as a tool for AI agents
You can now search within subfolders, making it easier to find workflows across all folder levels. Just type in the search bar and go.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes
#
MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.
While it‚Äôs still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.
We are adding two new nodes:
a MCP
Server Trigger
for any workflow
a MCP
Client Tool
for the AI Agent
The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.
Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:
Studio Update #04
MCP Server Trigger
#
The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.
MCP Server Trigger
Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs
MCP Client Tool
#
The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

Folders
#
What can we say about folders? Well, they‚Äôre super handy for categorizing just about everything and they‚Äôre finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It‚Äôs one of the ways we‚Äôre making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.
How to use it:
Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.
It's a folder alright
Folders are available for all
registered
users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.
Enhancements to Form Trigger Node
#
Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.
HTML customization:
Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.
Custom CSS support
: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand‚Äôs look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.
Form previews:
Your form‚Äôs description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.
Hidden fields:
Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data‚Äîsuch as a referral source‚Äîwithout exposing it to the user.
New responses options:
Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.
Form with custom CSS applied
These improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.

Schema Preview
#
Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node‚Äôs expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.
See expected node outputs instantly.
View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.
Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.
Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.
Avoid unwanted executions when building.
Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.
How to use it:
Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.
Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.
Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.
Don‚Äôt forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

Tidy up
#
Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at‚Äîthey‚Äôre also quicker to understand.
How to:
Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options:
Click the
Tidy up
button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom üßπ)
Press
Shift + Alt + T
on your keyboard
Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select
Tidy up workflow
Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them.
Multiple API keys
#
n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls.

Improved partial executions
#
The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows.
Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development.
This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Improved consistency across environments
#
We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.
Previously, users faced issues like:
Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes
Incomplete synchronization, where changes ‚Äî such as deletions ‚Äî weren‚Äôt always applied across environments
Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled
We addressed these by:
Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes
Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments
Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what‚Äôs being pushed
Commit modal
Pull notification

Overhauled Code node editing experience
#
We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:
TypeScript autocomplete
TypeScript linting
TypeScript hover tips
Search and replace
New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap
Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)
Remember folded regions and history after refresh
Multi cursor
Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types
Drag and drop for all Code node modes
Indentation markers
We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing.
To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. üëá
Studio Update #04
New node: Microsoft Entra ID
#
Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is used for cloud-based identity and access management.
The new node
supports a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups.
Node updates

Task runners for the Code node in public beta
#
We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.
Task runners overview
Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.
The Task runner comes in two modes:
Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes
External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security
Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using
environment variables
. Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.
To start using Task runners today,
check out the docs
.
Node updates
#
AI Transform node

New canvas in beta
#
The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.
We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well.
Node updates
#
We added credential support for
Zabbix
to the HTTP request node
We added new OAuth2 credentials for
Microsoft SharePoint
The
Slack node
now uses markdown for the approval message when using the
Send and Wait for Approval
operation

This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.
Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates
#
The
Remove Duplicates node
got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:
Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates
Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.
This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by
id
or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their
order date
. The great thing is, you can now do this within
and across
workflow runs.
New node: Gong
#
The new node for
Gong
allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

Breaking change
What changed?
The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.
The worker server's
/healthz
used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of
/healthz/readiness
.
When is action necessary?
If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT
.
If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking
/healthz/readiness
instead of
/healthz
.
This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.
Node updates
#
OpenAI
: Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID
Gmail
and
Slack
: Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow
We have also optimized the
worker health checks
(see breaking change above).
Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

Release date:
2024-10-02
This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.
Skipped 1.62.0
We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.
Additional nodes as tools
#
We have made additional nodes usable with the
Tools AI Agent node
.
Additionally, we have added a
$fromAI()
placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.
Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.
Node updates
#
Google BigQuery
: Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings
HTTP Request
: Added credential support for Sysdig
Invoice Ninja
: Additional query params for getAll requests
Question and Answer Chain
: Added the option to use a custom prompt
Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.
Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an
Execution Data Node
(or Code node) to the workflow to set
custom executions data
.

Improved execution queue handling
#
We are
exposing new execution queue metrics
to give users more visibility of the queue length. This helps to inform decisions on horizontal scaling, based on queue status. We have also made querying executions faster.
New credentials for the HTTP Request node
#
We added credential support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic Security, Filescan, Iris, and Malcore to the HTTP Request node making it easier to use existing credentials.
We also made it easier to select workflows as tools when working with AI agents by implementing a new
workflow selector
parameter type.

Backup recommended
Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.
Credential sharing required for manual executions
Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to
share the credential
with you.
New feature: Projects
#
With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.
Refer to the
RBAC
documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.
The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to
Pricing
for details.
New node: Slack Trigger
#
This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the
Slack Trigger documentation
for details.
Other highlights
#
Improved
memory support for OpenAI assistants
.
Rolling back to a previous version
#
If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:
Self-hosted n8n:
Delete any RBAC projects you created.
Revert the database migrations using
n8n db:revert
.
Cloud: contact

Convert to File
to take input data and output it as a file.
Extract From File
to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.
n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for
HTML
and
XML
.

LangChain in n8n (beta)
#
Release date:
2023-10-04

Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.
Read more:
This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in
Access LangChain in n8n
