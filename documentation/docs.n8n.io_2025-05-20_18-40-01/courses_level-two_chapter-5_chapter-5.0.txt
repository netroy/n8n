Automating a business workflow
#
Remember
our friend Nathan
?
Nathan 🙋:
Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.
You 👩‍🔧:
More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?
Nathan 🙋:
I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.
You 👩‍🔧:
Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!
Workflow design
#
Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:
Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
Sort the data and format the dates.
Write binary files.
Send notifications using email and Discord.
n8n provides
core nodes
for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:
A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
A workflow that generates the reports.
A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.
Workflow prerequisites
#
To build the workflows, you will need the following:
An
Airtable
account and
credentials
.
A
Google
account and
credentials
to access Gmail.
A
Discord
account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).
Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.
