Node types

This feature uses
Cluster nodes
: groups of
root
and
sub
nodes that work together.
Cluster nodes
are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a
root node
and one or more
sub-nodes
that extend the functionality of the node.

You can browse
workflow templates
in-app or on the n8n website
