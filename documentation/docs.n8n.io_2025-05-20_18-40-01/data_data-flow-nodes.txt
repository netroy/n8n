Data flow within nodes
#
Nodes can process multiple items.
For example, if you set the Trello node to
Create-Card
, and create an expression that sets
Name
using a property called
name-input-value
from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the
name-input-value
of the current item.
For example, this input will create two cards. One named
test1
the other one named
test2
:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
[
{
na
me
-
i
n
pu
t
-
value
:
"test1"
},
{
na
me
-
i
n
pu
t
-
value
:
"test2"
}
]
