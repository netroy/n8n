In the Webhook node, set

Workflow behavior
#
When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:
The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.
Return more than one data item (deprecated)
#
Deprecated in 1.22.0
n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the
All Incoming Items
option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.
The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using
expressions
. You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.
If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:
Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the
When Last Node Finishes
option in
Respond
in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
Use the
Aggregate
node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set
Aggregate
to
All Item Data (Into a Single List)
.
