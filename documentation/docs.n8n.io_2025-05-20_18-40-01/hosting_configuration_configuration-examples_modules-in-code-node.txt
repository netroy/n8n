Enable modules in Code node
#
For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN
: For built-in modules
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL
: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.
