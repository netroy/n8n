Queue mode environment variables
#
File-based configuration
You can add
_FILE
to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to
Keeping sensitive data in separate files
for more details.
You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. Queue mode provides the best scalability. Refer to
Queue mode
for more information.
