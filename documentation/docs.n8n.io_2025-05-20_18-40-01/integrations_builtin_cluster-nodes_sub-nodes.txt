Sub nodes
#
Sub nodes attach to root nodes within a group of cluster nodes. They configure the overall functionality of the cluster.
Cluster nodes
are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a
root node
and one or more
sub-nodes
that extend the functionality of the node.
