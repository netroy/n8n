Resolve "Consumer key is missing" error
#
When you try to connect your credentials, you may receive an error like this:
Consumer key is missing

To resolve it, turn on the
Include Credentials in Query
toggle to pass the consumer key/secret as query string parameters instead and retry the credential.
