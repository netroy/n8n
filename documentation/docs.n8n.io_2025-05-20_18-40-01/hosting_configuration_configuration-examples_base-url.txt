Configure the Base URL for n8n's front end access
#
Requires manual UI build
This use case involves configuring the
VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API
environmental variable which requires a manual build of the
n8n-editor-ui
package. You can't use it with the default n8n Docker image where the default setting for this variable is
/
, meaning that it uses the root-domain.
You can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately.
