Using API key
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A
Tracking API Key
: For use with the
Track API
at
https://track.customer.io/api/v1/
. See the FAQs below for more details.
Your
Region
: Customer.io uses different API subdomains depending on the region you select. Options include:
Global region
: Keeps the default URLs for both APIs; for use in all non-EU countries/regions.
EU region
: Adjusts the Track API subdomain to
track-eu
and the App API subdomain to
api-eu
; only use this if you are in the EU.
A
Tracking Site ID
: Required with your
Tracking API Key
An
App API Key
: For use with the
App API
at
https://api.customer.io/v1/api/
. See the FAQs below for more details.
Refer to the
Customer.io Finding and managing your API credentials documentation
for instructions on creating both Tracking API and App API keys.
Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key
#
Customer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:
The
Track API
at
https://track.customer.io/api/v1/
The
App API
at
https://api.customer.io/v1/api/
The Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.
Based on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint.
