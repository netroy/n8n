Using OAuth2
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
A
Client ID
: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.
A
Client Secret
: Generated when you create a Pushbullet app, also known as an OAuth client.
To generate the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
, go to the
create client
page. Copy the
OAuth Redirect URL
from n8n and add this as your
redirect_uri
for the app/client. Use the
client_id
and
client_secret
from the OAuth Client in your n8n credential.
Refer to Pushbullet's
OAuth2 Guide
for more information.
Pushbullet OAuth test link
Pushbullet offers a test link during the client creation process described above. This link isn't compatible with n8n. To verify the authentication works, use the
Connect my account
button in n8n.
