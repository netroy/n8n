Designing the Workflow
#
Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve his goals:
Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning
Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:
Discord
Airtable
Before that, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).
n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:

You will build this workflow in eight steps:
Getting data from the data warehouse
Inserting data into Airtable
Filtering orders
Setting values for processing orders
Calculating booked orders
Notifying the team
Scheduling the workflow
Activating and examining the workflow
