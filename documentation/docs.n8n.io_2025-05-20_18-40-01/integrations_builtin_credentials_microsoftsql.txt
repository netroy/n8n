Microsoft SQL credentials
#
You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:
Microsoft SQL
Prerequisites
#
Create a user account on a
Microsoft SQL server
database.
Supported authentication methods
#
SQL database connection
Related resources
#
Refer to
Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation
for more information about connecting to the service.
Using SQL database connection
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
The
Server
name
The
Database
name
Your
User
account/ID
Your
Password
The
Port
to use for the connection
The
Domain
name
Whether to use
TLS
Whether to
Ignore SSL Issues
The
Connect Timeout
The
Request Timeout
The
TDS Version
the connection should use
To set up the database connection:
Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the
Server
. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format
HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME
. Find the host name:
In the
Object Explorer
pane as the top-level object for your database.
In the footer of a query window.
Viewing the current connection
Properties
and looking for
Name
or
Display Name
.
Refer to
Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server
for more information. You can also find the information in the
Error logs
.
Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the
Database
name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.
If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default
MSSQLSERVER
instance name.
Enter your
User
account name or ID.
Enter your
Password
.
For the
Port
:
SQL Server defaults to
1433
.
If you can't connect over port 1433, check the
Error logs
for the phrase
Server is listening on
to identify the port number you should enter.
You only need to enter the
Domain
name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:
1
SELECT
DEFAULT_DOMAIN
()[
DomainName
];
Select whether to use
TLS
.
Select whether to
Ignore SSL Issues
: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the
Connect Timeout
. Refer to the
SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation
for more information.
SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.
Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the
Request Timeout
. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to
Troubleshoot query time-out errors
for more information.
Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the
TDS Version
dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to
Appendix A: Product Behavior
for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:
7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)
: TDS version 7.4.
7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)
: TDS version 7.3.B.
7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)
: TDS version 7.3.A.
7_2 (SQL Server 2005)
: TDS version 7.2.
7_1 (SQL Server 2000)
: TDS version 7.1.
