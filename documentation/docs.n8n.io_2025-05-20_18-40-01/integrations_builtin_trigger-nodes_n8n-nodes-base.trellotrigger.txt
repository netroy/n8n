Find the Model ID
#
The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.
For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:
Open the Trello board that contains the list.
If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
Open the card, add
.json
at the end of the URL, and press enter.
In the JSON file, you will see a field called
idList
.
Copy
idList
and paste it in the
Model ID
field in n8n.
