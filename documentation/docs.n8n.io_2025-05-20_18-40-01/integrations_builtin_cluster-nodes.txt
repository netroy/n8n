Cluster nodes
#
Cluster nodes
are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a
root node
and one or more
sub-nodes
that extend the functionality of the node.
Root nodes
#
Each cluster starts with one
root node
.
Sub-nodes
#
Each root node can have one or more
sub-nodes
attached to it.
