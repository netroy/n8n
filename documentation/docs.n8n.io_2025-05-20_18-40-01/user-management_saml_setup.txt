Available from version 0.225.0.
This page tells you how to enable SAML SSO (single sign-on) in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with SAML. If you're not,

Enable SAML
#
In n8n, go to
Settings
>
SSO
.
Make a note of the n8n
Redirect URL
and
Entity ID
.
Optional
: if your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the
Entity ID
URL and save the XML.
Optional
: if you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have
N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
configured.
Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.
After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:
Metadata URL
: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the
Identity Provider Settings
field in n8n.
Raw XML
: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle
Identiy Provider Settings
to
XML
, then copy the raw XML into
Identity Provider Settings
.
Select
Save settings
.
Select
Test settings
to check your SAML setup is working.
Set SAML 2.0 to
Activated
.
SAML Request Type
Please note, n8n currently doesn't support
POST
binding. Please configure your IdP to use
HTTP
request binding instead.
