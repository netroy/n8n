All executions
#
To view
all executions
from an n8n instance, navigate to the
Overview
page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.
If your n8n instance supports
projects
, you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.
Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
