Hardening task runners
#
Task runners
are responsible for executing code from the
Code node
. While Code node executions are secure, you can follow these recommendations to further harden your task runners.
Run task runners as sidecars in external mode
#
To increase the isolation between the core n8n process and code in the Code node, run task runners in
external mode
. External task runners launch as separate containers, providing a fully isolated environment to execute the JavaScript defined in the Code node.
