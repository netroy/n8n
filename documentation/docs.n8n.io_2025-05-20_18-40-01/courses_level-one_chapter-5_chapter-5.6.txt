View workflow file
Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the
n8n server
on Discord.
Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the
#course-level-1
channel.
Communication app nodes
You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for
Slack
and
Mattermost
.
In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.
When you search for the Discord node, look for
Message Actions
and select
Send a message
to add the node.
In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:
Connection Type
: Select
Webhook
.
Credential for Discord Webhook
: Select
- Create New Credential -
.
Copy the
Webhook URL
from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the
Webhook URL
field of the credentials.
Select
Save
and then close the credentials dialog.
Operation
: Select
Send a Message
.
Message
:
Select the
Expression
tab on the right side of the Message field.
Copy the text below and paste it into the
Expression
window, or construct it manually using the
Expression Editor
.

: Incredible, you've saved me hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM.
You üë©‚Äçüîß
: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.
