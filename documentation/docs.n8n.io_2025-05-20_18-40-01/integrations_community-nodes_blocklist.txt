n8n community node blocklist
#
n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.
n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:
The node is intentionally malicious
It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)
If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact
