You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:
In the HTTP Request node, select
Authentication
>
Predefined Credential Type
.
Select the service you want to connect to.
Select your credential.
Refer to

Find the List ID

Open the Trello board that contains the list.
If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
Open the card, add
.json
at the end of the URL, and press enter.
In the JSON file, you will see a field called
idList
.
Copy the contents of the
