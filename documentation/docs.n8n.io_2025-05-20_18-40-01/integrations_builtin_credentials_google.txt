OAuth2 and Service Account
#
There are two authentication methods available for Google services nodes:
OAuth2
: Recommended because it's more widely available and easier to set up.
Service Account
: Refer to the
Google documentation: Understanding service accounts
for guidance on when you need a service account.

Gmail and Service Accounts
Google technically supports Service Accounts for use with Gmail, but it requires enabling domain-wide delegation, which Google discourages, and its behavior can be inconsistent.
n8n recommends using OAuth2 with the Gmail node.
