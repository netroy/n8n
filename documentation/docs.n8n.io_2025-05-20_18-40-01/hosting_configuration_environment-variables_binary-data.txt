Binary data environment variables
#
File-based configuration
You can add
_FILE
to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to
Keeping sensitive data in separate files
for more details.
By default, n8n uses memory to store binary data. Enterprise users can choose to use an external service instead. Refer to
External storage
for more information on using external storage for binary data.
Variable
Type
Default
Description
N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES
String
filesystem
A comma separated list of available binary data modes.
N8N_BINARY_DATA_STORAGE_PATH
String
N8N_USER_FOLDER/binaryData
The path where n8n stores binary data.
N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE
String
default
The default binary data mode.
default
keeps binary data in memory. Set to
filesystem
to use the filesystem, or
s3
to AWS S3. Note that binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.
