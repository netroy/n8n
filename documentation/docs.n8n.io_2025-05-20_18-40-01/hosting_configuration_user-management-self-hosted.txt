Setup
#
There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:
Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
Invite users.
Step one: SMTP
#
n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.
Optional from 0.210.1
From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.
Get the following information from your SMTP provider:
Server name
SMTP username
SMTP password
SMTP sender name
To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to
