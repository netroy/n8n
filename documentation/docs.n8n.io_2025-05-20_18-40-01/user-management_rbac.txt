Role-based access control (RBAC)
#
Feature availability
RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's
pricing page
for plan details.
Role types and account types
Role types and
account types
are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different
projects
.
RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and
credentials
based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.
