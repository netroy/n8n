An
API Key
: Generate an API key in the
API keys section

Mailchimp's Generate your API key documentation
for more detailed instructions.
Using OAuth2
#
Note for n8n Cloud users
Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select
Connect my account
to connect through your browser.
If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch,
register an application
. Refer to the
Mailchimp OAuth2 documentation
for more information.
Selecting an authentication method
#
Mailchimp suggests using an API key if you're only accessing your own Mailchimp account's data:
Use an API key if you're writing code that tightly couples
your
application's data to
your
Mailchimp account's data. If you ever need to access
someone else's
Mailchimp account's data, you should be using OAuth 2 (
