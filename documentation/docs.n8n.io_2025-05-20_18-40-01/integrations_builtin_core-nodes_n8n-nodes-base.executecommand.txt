Execute Command
#
The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.
Which shell runs the command?
This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example,
cmd
on Windows and
zsh
on macOS.
If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.
Not available on Cloud
This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Node parameters
#
Configure the node using the following parameters.
Execute Once
#
Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).
Command
#
Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running
multiple commands
and
cURL commands
.
Run multiple commands
#
Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:
Enter each command on one line separated by
&&
. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using
&&
.
1
cd
bin
&&
ls
Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.
1
2
cd
bin
ls
Run cURL command
#
You can also use the
HTTP Request
node to make a cURL request.
If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.
Create a file named
Dockerfile
.
Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.
1
2
3
4
FROM
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
USER
root
RUN
apk
--update
add
curl
USER
node
In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.
1
docker
build
-t
n8n-curl
Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
with
n8n-curl
.
Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.
