To configure this credential, you'll need to have a
RabbitMQ broker
installed and:
Enter the
Hostname
for the RabbitMQ broker.
Enter the
Port
the connection should use.
Enter a
User
the connection should use to log in as.
The default is
guest
. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to
Access Control | The Basics
for more information. If you're using the
guest
account with a non-localhost connection, refer to
guest
user issues
below for troubleshooting tips.
Enter the user's
Password
.
The default password for the
guest
user is
guest
.
Enter the
virtual host
the connection should use as the
Vhost
. The default virtual host is

.
Select whether the connection should use
SSL
. If turned on, also set:
Passwordless

guest user issues
#
If you use the
guest
user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:
1
[error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost
This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default
guest
user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the
localhost
.
To resolve this error, you can:
Update the
guest
user to allow it remote host access.
Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The
guest
user is the only user limited by default.
Refer to
"guest" user can only connect from localhost
for more information.
