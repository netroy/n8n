Fetch issues for a specific project
#
The
Get All
operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).
For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named
n8n
, you'd do something like this:
Select
Get All
from the
Operation
dropdown list.
Toggle
Return All
to true.
Select
Add Option
and select
JQL
.
Enter
project=n8n
in the
JQL
field.
This query will fetch all the issues in the project named
n8n
. Enter the name of your project instead of
n8n
to fetch all the issues for your project.
