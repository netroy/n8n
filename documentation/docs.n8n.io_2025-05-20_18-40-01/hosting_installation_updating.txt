Update self-hosted n8n
#
It's important to keep your n8n version up to date. This ensures you get the latest features and fixes.
Some tips when updating:
Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
Check the
Release notes
for breaking changes.
Use
Environments
to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.
For instructions on how to update, refer to the documentation for your installation method:
Installed with npm
Installed with Docker
