Common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the Microsoft Entra ID node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails
#
You can't update the
Allow External Senders
and
Auto Subscribe New Members
options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.
When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a
Wait
node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.
