Best practices for updating
#
Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.
Check the
Release notes
for breaking changes.
Use
Environments
to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.
Automatic update
#
n8n automatically updates outdated Cloud instances.
If you don't update you instance for 120 days, n8n emails you to warn you to update. After a further 30 days, n8n automatically updates your instance.
