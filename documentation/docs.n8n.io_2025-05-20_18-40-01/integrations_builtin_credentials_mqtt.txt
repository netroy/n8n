Refer to
MQTT's documentation

Using broker connection
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
Your MQTT broker's
Protocol
The
Host
The
Port
A
Username
and
Password
to authenticate with
If you're using
SSL
, the relevant certificates and keys
To set things up:
Select the broker's
Protocol
, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
Mqtt
: Begin the URL with the standard
mqtt:
protocol.
Mqtts
: Begin the URL with the secure
mqtts:
protocol.
Ws
: Begin the URL with the WebSocket
ws:
protocol.
Enter your broker
Host
.
Enter the
Port
number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
Enter the
Username
to log into the broker as.
Enter that user's
Password
.
If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the
Clean Session
toggle.
Enter a
Client ID
you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with
n8n
in it for easier auditing.
If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the
SSL
toggle on. Once you turn it on:
Select whether to use
Passwordless
connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
Select whether to
Reject Unauthorized Certificate
: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
Add an SSL
Client Certificate
.
Add an SSL
Client Key
for the Client Certificate.
One or more SSL
CA Certificates
.
Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.
