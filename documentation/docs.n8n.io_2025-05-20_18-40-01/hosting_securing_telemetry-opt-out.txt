Data collection
#
n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.
Collected data
#
Refer to
Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n
for details on the data n8n collects.
How collection works
#
Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.
Opting out of data collection
#
n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.
Opt out of telemetry events

export
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED
=
false
Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n
#
To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the
N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
environment variable to false, for example:
