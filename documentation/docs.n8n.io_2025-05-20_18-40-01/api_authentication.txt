API authentication
#
n8n uses API keys to authenticate API calls.
Feature availability
The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.
API Scopes
#
Users of
enterprise instances
can limit which resources and actions a key can access with scopes. API key scopes allow you specify the exact level of access a key needs for its intended purpose.
Non-enterprise API keys have full access to all the account's resources and capabilities.
Create an API key
#
Log in to n8n.
Go to
Settings
>
n8n API
.
Select
Create an API key
.
Choose a
Label
and set an
Expiration
time for the key.
If on an enterprise plan, choose the
Scopes
to give the key.
Copy
My API Key
and use this key to authenticate your calls.
Call the API using your key
#
Send the API key in your API call as a header named
X-N8N-API-KEY
.
