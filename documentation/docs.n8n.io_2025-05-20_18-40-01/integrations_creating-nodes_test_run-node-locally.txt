Run your node locally
#
You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.
Install n8n using npm:
1
npm
install
n8n
-g
When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
1
2
3
# In your node directory
npm
run
build
npm
link
Install the node into your local n8n instance:
1
2
3
# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
# node-package-name is the name from the package.json
npm
link
<node-package-name>
Check your directory
Make sure you run
npm link <node-name>
in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:
~/.n8n/custom/
~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>
: if your n8n installation set a different name using
N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS
.
Start n8n:
1
n8n start
Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.
Node names
Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is
n8n-nodes-weather-nodes
, and the package contains nodes named
rain
,
sun
,
snow
, you should search for
rain
, not
weather-nodes
.
Troubleshooting
#
There's no
custom
directory in
~/.n8n
local installation.
You have to create
custom
directory manually and run
npm init
1
2
3
4
# In ~/.n8n directory run
mkdir
custom
cd
custom
npm
init
