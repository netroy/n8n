Airtable Trigger node
#
Airtable
is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.
On this page, you'll find a list of events the Airtable Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

Every Hour
Every Day
Every Week
Every Month
Every X: Check for updates every given number of minutes or hours.
Custom: Customize the polling interval by providing a
cron expression
.
Use the
