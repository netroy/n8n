To create a
Record ID
column in your table, refer to this
article
. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.
Use the List operation
#
To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the
List
operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.
Filter records when using the List operation
#
To filter records from your Airtable base, use the
Filter By Formula
option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization
n8n
, follow the steps mentioned below:
Select 'List' from the
Operation
dropdown list.
Enter the base ID and the table name in the
Base ID
and
Table
field, respectively.
Click on
Add Option
and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
Enter the following formula in the
Filter By Formula
field:
{Organization}='n8n'
.
Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization
n8n
, use the following formula:
NOT({Organization}='n8n')
.
Refer to the Airtable
documentation
to learn more about the formulas.
