and
Standard
key types.
Here are more details on the different API key types:
Main
: This key type gives you the same level of access as using your Account SID and Auth Token in API requests.
Standard
: This key type gives you access to all the functionality in Twilio's APIs except the API key resources and Account resources.
Restricted
: This key type is in beta. n8n hasn't tested the credential against this key type; if you try it, let us know if you run into any issues.
