Workflow Trigger node
#
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.
Deprecated
n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the
n8n Trigger node
.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters
#
The node includes a single parameter to identify the
Events
that should trigger it. Choose from these events:
Active Workflow Updated
: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
Workflow Activated
: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.
You can select one or both of these events.
