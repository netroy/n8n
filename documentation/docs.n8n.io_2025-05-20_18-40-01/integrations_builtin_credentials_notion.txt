Internal vs. public integrations
#
Internal
integrations are:
Specific to a single workspace.
Accessible only to members of that workspace.
Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.
Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.
Public
integrations are:
Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
Ideal for catering to broad use cases.
Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.
For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's
Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation
