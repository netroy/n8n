An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items.
You need to understand this behavior if you're:

Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.
Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.
