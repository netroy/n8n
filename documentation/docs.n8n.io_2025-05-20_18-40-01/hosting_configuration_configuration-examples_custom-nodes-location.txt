Specify location for your custom nodes
#
Every user can add custom nodes that get loaded by n8n on startup. The default
location is in the subfolder
.n8n/custom
of the user who started n8n.
You can define more folders with an environment variable:
1
export
N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS
=
"/home/jim/n8n/custom-nodes;/data/n8n/nodes"
Refer to
Environment variables reference
for more information on this variable.
