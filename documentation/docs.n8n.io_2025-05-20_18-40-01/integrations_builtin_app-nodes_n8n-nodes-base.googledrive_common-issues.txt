Google Drive node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Google Drive node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Google hasn't verified this app
#
If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning
Google hasn't verified this app
. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in
Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app
.
Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized
#
For Google Cloud apps with
Publishing status
set to
Testing
and
User type
set to
External
, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to
Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen
for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.
Google Drive OAuth error
#
If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.
Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.
If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the
N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
and
WEBHOOK_URL
environment variables use fully qualified domains.
Get recent files from Google Drive
#
To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.
