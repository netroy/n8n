Enable Prometheus metrics
#
To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the
prom-client
library.
The
/metrics
endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the
N8N_METRICS
environment variable.
1
export
N8N_METRICS
=
true
Refer to the respective
Environment Variables
(
N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*
) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.
Both
main
and
worker
instances are able to expose metrics.
Queue metrics
#
To enable queue metrics, set the
N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS
env var to
true
. You can adjust the refresh rate with
N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL
.
Queue metrics are only available for the
main
instance in single-main mode.
