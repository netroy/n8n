Projects
Feature availability
RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's
pricing page
for plan details.
n8n uses projects to group workflows and
credentials
, and assigns
roles
to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.

Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project
: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
Delete its workflows and credentials
: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.
Move workflows and credentials between projects or users
#
Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.
Moving revokes sharing
Moving workflows or credentials removes all existing sharing. Be aware that this could impact other workflows currently sharing these resources.
Select
Workflow menu
or
Credential menu
>
Move
.
Moving workflows with credentials
When moving a workflow with credentials you have permission to share, you can choose to share the credentials as well. This ensures that the workflow continues to have access to the credentials it needs to execute. n8n will note any credentials that can't be moved (credentials you don't have permission to share).
Select the project or user you want to move to.
Select
Next
.
Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.
Select
Confirm move to new project
.
Using external secrets in projects
#
To use
external secrets
in a project, you must have an
instance owner or instance admin
as a member of the project.
