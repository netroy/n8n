Securing n8n
#
Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.
At a high level, you can:
Conduct a
security audit
to identify security risks.
Set up SSL
to enforce secure connections.
Set up Single Sign-On
for user account management.
Use
two-factor authentication (2FA)
for your users.
More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:
Disable the public API
if you aren't using it.
Opt out of data collection
of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
Block certain nodes
from being available to your users.
