Programmatic-style execute() method
#
The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an
execute()
method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the
routing
key in the
operations
object.
The
execute()
method creates and returns an instance of
INodeExecutionData
