Monitoring
#
There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance:
/healthz
,
healthz/readiness
, and
/metrics
.
healthz and healthz/readiness
#
The
/healthz
endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/healthz
The
/healthz/readiness
endpoint is similar to the
/healthz
endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
metrics
#
The
/metrics
endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.
Access the endpoint:
1
<your-instance-url>/metrics
Feature availability
The
/metrics
endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.
Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n
#
The
/metrics
and
/healthz
endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:
1
2
3
4
# metrics
N8N_METRICS
=
true
# healthz
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE
=
true
Refer to
Configuration methods
for more information on how to configure your instance using environment variables.
