Workflow-level executions list
#
The
Executions
list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.
Deleted workflows
When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.
Execution history and workflow history
Don't confuse the execution list with
Workflow history
.
Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to
Debug and re-run past executions
in your current workflow.
Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.
View executions for a single workflow

In the workflow, select the
Executions

Retry failed workflows
#
If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:
Open the
Executions
list.
For the workflow execution you want to retry, select
Refresh
.
Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
Retry with currently saved workflow
: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
Retry with original workflow
: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.
