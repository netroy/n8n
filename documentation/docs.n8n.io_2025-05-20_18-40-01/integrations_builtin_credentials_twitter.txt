authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version
0.236.0
.

X rate limits
This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to
X rate limits
below for more information.
X rate limits
#
X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to
Rate limits
for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.
Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:
If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
If you're
Using OAuth2
, app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.
X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.
Refer to X's
Rate limits and authentication methods
for more information about these rate limit types.
