Optional:
Select whether to use
Sandbox Mode
for calls made using this credential. When turned on, all API calls use Sandbox mode: the API will still validate the payloads but won't deliver the actual messages. This can be useful to troubleshoot any payload error messages without actually sending messages. Refer to Mailjet's
Sandbox Mode documentation
for more information.

Mailjet's primary API key and secret key
A subaccount API key and secret key
Refer to Mailjet's
How to create a subaccount (or additional API key) documentation
for detailed instructions on creating more API keys. Refer to
What are subaccounts and how does it help me?
page for more information on Mailjet subaccounts and when you might want to use one.
