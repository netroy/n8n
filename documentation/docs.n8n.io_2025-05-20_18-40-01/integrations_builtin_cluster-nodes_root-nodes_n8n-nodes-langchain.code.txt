LangChain Code node
#
Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.
On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.
Not available on Cloud
This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.
Node parameters
#
Add Code
#
Add your custom code. Choose either
Execute
or
Supply Data
mode. You can only use one mode.
Unlike the
Code node
, the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.
Execute
: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in
Inputs
and
Outputs
.
Supply Data
: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.
By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can
enable built-in and external modules
.
Inputs
#
Choose the input types.
The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node,
Execute
code is required.
Outputs
#
Choose the output types.
The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node,
Execute
code is required.
Node inputs and outputs configuration
#
By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.
Node type
Inputs
Outputs
Code mode
App node. Similar to the
Code node
.
Main
Main
Execute
Root node
Main; at least one other type
Main
Execute
Sub-node
-
A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to.
Supply Data
Sub-node with sub-nodes
A type other than main
A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to.
Supply Data
Built-in methods
#
n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.
Method
Description
this.addInputData(inputName, data)
Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.
inputName
is the input connection type, and must be one of:
ai_agent
,
ai_chain
,
ai_document
,
ai_embedding
,
ai_languageModel
,
ai_memory
,
ai_outputParser
,
ai_retriever
,
ai_textSplitter
,
ai_tool
,
ai_vectorRetriever
,
ai_vectorStore
data
contains the data you want to add. Refer to
Data structure
for information on the data structure expected by n8n.
this.addOutputData(outputName, data)
Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.
outputName
is the input connection type, and must be one of:
ai_agent
,
ai_chain
,
ai_document
,
ai_embedding
,
ai_languageModel
,
ai_memory
,
ai_outputParser
,
ai_retriever
,
ai_textSplitter
,
ai_tool
,
ai_vectorRetriever
,
ai_vectorStore
data
contains the data you want to add. Refer to
Data structure
for information on the data structure expected by n8n.
this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)
Get data from a specified non-main input.
inputName
is the input connection type, and must be one of:
ai_agent
,
ai_chain
,
ai_document
,
ai_embedding
,
ai_languageModel
,
ai_memory
,
ai_outputParser
,
ai_retriever
,
ai_textSplitter
,
ai_tool
,
ai_vectorRetriever
,
ai_vectorStore
itemIndex
should always be
0
(this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality)
Use
inputIndex
if there is more than one node connected to the specified input.
this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)
Get data from the main input.
this.getNode()
Get the current node.
this.getNodeOutputs()
Get the outputs of the current node.
this.getExecutionCancelSignal()
Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the
Cancelling a running LLMChain
code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally.

completion
: Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
hallucinations
: Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
vector database
: A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
vector store
: A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
