What's a tool in AI?
#
In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.
Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:
Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world (

)
We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call (

AI tools in n8n
#
n8n provides tool
sub-nodes
that you can connect to your
AI agent
. As well as providing some popular tools, such as
Wikipedia
and
SerpAPI
, n8n provides three especially powerful tools:
Call n8n Workflow Tool
: use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
Custom Code Tool
: write code that your agent can run.
HTTP Request Tool
: make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.
The next three examples highlight the Call n8n Workflow Tool:
Chat with Google Sheets
Call an API to fetch data
Set up a human fallback
You can also learn how to
let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the
$fromAI()
function
.
