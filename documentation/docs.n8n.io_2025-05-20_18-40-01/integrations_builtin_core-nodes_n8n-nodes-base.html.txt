HTML
#
The HTML node provides operations to help you work with HTML in n8n.
HTML Extract node
The HTML node replaces the HTML Extract node from version 0.213.0 on. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the

Cross-site scripting
When using the HTML node to generate an HTML template you can introduce
XSS (cross-site scripting)
. This is a security risk. Be careful with un-trusted inputs.
