Telegram node common issues
#
Here are some common errors and issues with the
Telegram node
and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.
Add a bot to a Telegram channel
#
For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:
Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel
.
To add a bot to a channel:
In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
Label the channel name as
public channel
.
Select
Administrators
>
Add Admin
.
Search for the bot's username and select it.
Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.
Get the Chat ID
#
You can only use
@channelusername
on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.
There are three ways to get that ID:
From the Telegram Trigger: Use the
Telegram Trigger
node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a
-
when you enter it in n8n.
Invite Telegram's
@RawDataBot
to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a
chat
object. The
id
for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.
Send more than 30 messages per second
#
The Telegram API has a
limitation
of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:
Loop Over Items node
: Use the
Loop Over Items
node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
Telegram node
: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the
Expression Editor
to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
Code node
: Connect the
Code
node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.
You can also use this
workflow
.
Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages
#
If you're using the node to
send Telegram messages
, the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:
This message was sent automatically with n8n
To remove this attribution:
In the node's
Additional Fields
section, select
Add Field
.
Select
Append n8n attribution
.
Turn the toggle off.
Refer to
Send Message additional fields
for more information.
