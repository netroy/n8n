Your first workflow
#
This guide will show you how to construct a
workflow
in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:
Create a workflow from scratch.
Understand key concepts and skills, including:
Starting workflows with trigger nodes
Configuring
credentials
Processing data
Representing logic in an n8n workflow
Using
expressions
This quickstart uses
n8n Cloud
, which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so,

Step one: Create a new workflow
#
When you open n8n, you'll see either:
A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose
Start from Scratch
to create a new workflow.
The
Workflows
list on the
Overview
page. Select the
Create Workflow
to create a new workflow.
Step two: Add a trigger node
#
n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:
Manually, by selecting
Test Workflow
.
Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.
For this tutorial, we'll use the
Schedule trigger
. This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:
Select
Add first step
.
Search for
Schedule
. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select
Schedule Trigger
to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
For
Trigger Interval
, select
Weeks
.
For
Weeks Between Triggers
, enter
1
.
Enter a time and day. For this example, select
Monday
in
Trigger on Weekdays
, select
9am
in
Trigger at Hour
, and enter
0
in
Trigger at Minute
.
Close the node details view to return to the canvas.
Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials
#
The
NASA node
interacts with NASA's
public APIs
to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.
Credentials
Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.
Select the
Add node
connector on the Schedule Trigger node.
Search for
NASA
. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select
NASA
to view a list of operations.
Search for and select
Get a DONKI solar flare
. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:
Select the
Credential for NASA API
dropdown.
Select
Create new credential
. n8n opens the credentials view.
Go to
NASA APIs
and fill out the form from the
Generate API Key
link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.
Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into
API Key
in n8n.
Select
Save
.
Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in
Credential for NASA API
.
By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use
Additional Fields
:
Select
Add field
.
Select
Start date
.
To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to
Start date
, select the
Expression
tab, then select the expand button
to open the full expressions editor.
In the
Expression
field, enter the following expression:
1
{{
$today
.
minus
(
7
,
'days'
)
}}
This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.
Date and time formats in n8n...
n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience:
$now
and
$today
. For more information, refer to
Expressions > Luxon
.
Close the
Edit Expression
modal to return to the NASA node.
You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select
Execute step
to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the
OUTPUT
section.
Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.
Step four: Add logic with the If node
#
n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the
If node
to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.
Add the If node:
Select the
Add node
connector on the NASA node.
Search for
If
. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select
If
to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
You need to check the value of the
classType
property in the NASA data. To do this:
Drag
classType
into
Value 1
.
Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section
If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.
Change the comparison operation to
String > Contains
.
In
Value 2
, enter
X
. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.
You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select
Execute step
to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the
OUTPUT
panel.
Weeks without large solar flares
In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing
X
in
Value 2
with either
A
,
B
,
C
, or
M
.
Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.
Step five: Output data from your workflow
#
The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to
Postbin
. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.
On the If node, select the
Add node
connector labeled
true
.
Search for
PostBin
. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
Select
PostBin
.
Select
Send a request
. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
Go to
Postbin
and select
Create Bin
. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.
Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to
1651063625300-2016451240051
.
In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into
Bin ID
.
Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to
Bin Content
, select the
Expression
tab (you will need to mouse-over the
Bin Content
for the tab to appear), then select the expand button
to open the full expressions editor.
You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.
Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference:
{{$json["classType"]}}
. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:
1
There
was
a
solar
flare
of
class
{{
$json
[
"classType"
]}}
Close the expressions editor to return to the node.
Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.
Add another Postbin node, to handle the
false
output path from the If node:
Hover over the Postbin node, then select
Node context menu
>
Duplicate node
to duplicate the first Postbin node.
Drag the
false
connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.
Step six: Test the workflow
#
You can now test the entire workflow. Select
Test Workflow
. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the
Active
toggle.
Time limit
Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.
Congratulations

You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:

Along the way you have discovered:
How to find the nodes you want and join them together
How to use expressions to manipulate data
How to create credentials and attach them to nodes
How to use logic in your workflows
There are plenty of things you could add to this (perhaps add some more credentials and a node to send you an email of the results), or maybe you have a specific project in mind. Whatever your next steps, the resources linked below should help.
