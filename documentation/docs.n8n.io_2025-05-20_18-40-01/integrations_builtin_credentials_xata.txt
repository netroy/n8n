Using API key
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
The
Database Endpoint
: The Workspace API requires that you identify the database you're requesting information from using this format:
https://{workspace-display-name}-{workspace-id}.{region}.xata.sh/db/{dbname}
. Refer to
Workspace API
for more information.
{workspace-display-name}
: The workspace display name is an optional identifier you can include in your Database Endpoint. The API ignores it, but including it can make it easier to figure out which workspace this database is in if you're saving multiple credentials.
{workspace-id}
: The unique ID of the workspace, 6 alphanumeric characters.
{region}
: The hosting region for the database. This value must match the database region configuration.
{dbname}
: The name of the database you're interacting with.
A
Branch
: Enter the name of the GitHub branch for your database.
An
API Key
: To generate an API key, go to
Account Settings
and select
+ Add a key
. Refer to
Generate an API Key
for more information.
