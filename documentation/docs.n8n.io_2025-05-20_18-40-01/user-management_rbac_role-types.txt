RBAC role types
#
Feature availability
The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.
Project Admin
#
A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:
Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.
Project Editor
#
A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.
Project Viewer
#
A Project Viewer is effectively a
read-only
role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.
Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.
Role types and account types
Role types and
account types
are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different
projects
.
