#
Refer to the
Matrix Specification
for more information about the service.
Refer to the documentation for the specific client you're using to access the Matrix server.
Using API access token
#
To configure this credential, you'll need:
An
Access Token
: This token is tied to the account you use to log into Matrix with.
A
Homeserver URL
: This is the URL of the
homeserver
you entered when you created your account. n8n prepopulates this with matrix.org's own server; adjust this if you're using a server hosted elsewhere.
Instructions for getting these details vary depending on the client you're using to access the server. Both the
Access Token
and the
Homeserver URL
can most commonly be found in
Settings > Help & About > Advanced
, but refer to your client's documentation for more details.
