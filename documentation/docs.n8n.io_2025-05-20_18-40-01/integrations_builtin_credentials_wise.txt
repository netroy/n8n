Wise protects some live endpoints and operations with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Refer to
Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA
for details.
If you make a request to an endpoint that requires SCA, Wise returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. The error returned will look like this:
This request requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Please add a key pair to your account and n8n credentials. See https://api-docs.transferwise.com/#strong-customer-authentication-personal-token
To use endpoints requiring SCA, generate an RSA key pair and add the relevant key information to both Wise and n8n:
Generate an RSA key pair:
