n8n metadata
#
Methods for working with n8n metadata.
This includes:
Access to n8n environment variables for self-hosted n8n.
Metadata about workflows, executions, and nodes.
Information about instance
Variables
and
External secrets
.
Python support
You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.
JavaScript
Python
Method
Description
Available in Code node?
$env
Contains n8n instance configuration
environment variables
.
$execution.customData
Set and get custom execution data. Refer to
Custom executions data
for more information.
$execution.id
The unique ID of the current workflow execution.
$execution.mode
Whether the execution was triggered automatically, or by manually running the workflow. Possible values are
test
and
production
.
$execution.resumeUrl
The webhook URL to call to resume a workflow waiting at a
Wait node
.
$getWorkflowStaticData(type)
View an
example
. Static data doesn't persist when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data. This gives access to the static workflow data.
$("<node-name>").isExecuted
Check whether a node has already executed.
$itemIndex
The index of an item in a list of items.
$nodeVersion
Get the version of the current node.
$prevNode.name
The name of the node that the current input came from. When using the Merge node, note that
$prevNode
always uses the first input connector.
$prevNode.outputIndex
The index of the output connector that the current input came from. Use this when the previous node had multiple outputs (such as an If or Switch node).  When using the Merge node, note that
$prevNode
always uses the first input connector.
$prevNode.runIndex
The run of the previous node that generated the current input. When using the Merge node, note that
$prevNode
always uses the first input connector.
$runIndex
How many times n8n has executed the current node. Zero-based (the first run is 0, the second is 1, and so on).
$secrets
Contains information about your
External secrets
setup.
$vars
Contains the
Variables
available in the active environment.
$version
The node version.
$workflow.active
Whether the workflow is active (true) or not (false).
$workflow.id
The workflow ID.
$workflow.name
The workflow name.
