Activation Trigger node
#
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.
Warning
n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the
n8n Trigger node
and the
Workflow Trigger node
. For more details, check out the entry in the
breaking changes
page.
Keep in mind
If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
Node parameters

Events
Activation
: Run when the workflow gets activated

Update
