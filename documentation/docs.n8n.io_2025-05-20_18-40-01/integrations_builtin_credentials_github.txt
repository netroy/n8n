Using API access token
#
To configure this credential, you'll need a
GitHub
account.
There are two steps to setting up this credential:
Generate a GitHub personal access token
.
Set up the credential
.
Refer to the sections below for detailed instructions.
Generate personal access token
#
Recommended access token type
n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.
To generate your personal access token:
If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to
Verifying your email address
for more information.
Open your GitHub profile
Settings
.
In the left navigation, select
Developer settings
.
In the left navigation, under
Personal access tokens
, select
Tokens (classic)
.
Select
Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)
.
Enter a descriptive name for your token in the
Note
field, like
n8n integration
.
Select the
Expiration
you'd like for the token, or select
No expiration
.
Select
Scopes
for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the
repo
scope.
A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
Refer to
Select
Generate token
.
Copy the token.
Refer to
Creating a personal access token (classic)
for more information. Refer to
Scopes for OAuth apps
for more information on GitHub scopes.
Set up the credential
#
Then, in your n8n credential:
If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the
GitHub server
URL.
If you're using
GitHub Enterprise Server
, update
GitHub server
to match the URL for your server.
Enter your
User
name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
Enter the
Access Token
you generated above.
Using OAuth2
#
Note for n8n Cloud users
Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select
Connect my account
to connect through your browser.
If you're
self-hosting n8n
, create a new GitHub
OAuth app
:
Open your GitHub profile
Settings
.
In the left navigation, select
Developer settings
.
In the left navigation, select
OAuth apps
.
Select
New OAuth App
.
If you haven't created an app before, you may see
Register a new application
instead. Select it.
Enter an
Application name
, like
n8n integration
.
Enter the
Homepage URL
for your app's website.
If you'd like, add the optional
Application description
, which GitHub displays to end-users.
From n8n, copy the
OAuth Redirect URL
and paste it into the GitHub
Authorization callback URL
.
Select
Register application
.
Copy the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
this generates and add them to your n8n credential.
Refer to the
GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation
for more information on the authorization process.
