4. Setting Values for Processing Orders
#
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to filter the data to only insert the
employeeName
and
orderID
of all
processing
orders into Airtable.
For this, you need to use the
Edit Fields (Set) node
, which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one node to another.
Edit Fields node
The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.
Add another node before the Airtable node
#
In your workflow, add another node before the
Airtable node
from the
If node
in the same way we did it in the
Filtering Orders
lesson on the If node's
true
connector. Feel free to drag the Airtable node further away if your canvas feels crowded.
Configure the Edit Fields node
#
Now search for the
Edit Fields (Set) node
after you've selected the
+
sign coming off the If node's
true
connector.
With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:
Ensure
Mode
is set to
Manual Mapping
.
While you can use the
Expression editor
we used in the
Filtering Orders
lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the
Input
into the
Fields to Set
:
Drag
If
>
orderID
as the first field.
Drag
If
>
employeeName
as the second field.
Ensure that
Include Other Input Fields
is set to false.
Select
Execute step
. You should see the following results:
Edit Fields (Set) node
Add data to Airtable
#
Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:
Go to your Airtable base.
Add a new table called
processingOrders
.
Replace the existing columns with two new columns:
orderID
(primary field): Number
employeeName
: Single line text
Reminder
If you get stuck, refer to the
Inserting data into Airtable
lesson.
Delete the three empty rows in the new table.
In n8n, connect the Edit Fields node
connector to the
Airtable node**.
Update the Airtable node configuration to point to the new
processingOrders
table instead of the
orders
table.
Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new
processingOrders
table.
At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:

Nathan üôã
: You've already automated half of my work! Now I still need to calculate the booked orders for my colleagues. Can we automate that as well?
You üë©‚Äçüîß
: Yes! In the next step, I'll use some JavaScript code in a node to calculate the booked orders.
