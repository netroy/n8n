Using client ID
#
To configure this credential, you'll need a running Kafka environment and:
A
Client ID
A list of relevant
Brokers
Username/password authentication details if your Kafka environment uses authentication
To set it up:
Enter the
CLIENT-ID
of the client or consumer group in the
Client ID
field in your credential.
Enter a comma-separated list of relevant
Brokers
for the credential to use in the format
<broker-service-name>:<port>
. Use the name you gave the broker when you defined it in the
services
list. For example,
kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092
would add the brokers
kafka-1
and
kafka-2
on port
9092
.
If your Kafka environment doesn't use SSL, turn off the
SSL
toggle.
If you've enabled authentication using SASL in your Kafka environment, turn on the
Authentication
toggle. Then add:
The
Username
The
Password
Select the broker's configured
SASL Mechanism
. Refer to
SASL configuration
for more information. Options include:
Plain
scram-sha-256
