Output of other nodes
#
Methods for working with the output of other nodes. Some methods and variables aren't available in the Code node.
Python support
You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.
JavaScript
Python
Method
Description
Available in Code node?
$("<node-name>").all(branchIndex?, runIndex?)
Returns all items from a given node. If
branchIndex
isn't given it will default to the output that connects
node-name
with the node where you use the expression or code.
$("<node-name>").first(branchIndex?, runIndex?)
The first item output by the given node. If
branchIndex
isn't given it will default to the output that connects
node-name
with the node where you use the expression or code.
$("<node-name>").last(branchIndex?, runIndex?)
The last item output by the given node. If
branchIndex
isn't given it will default to the output that connects
node-name
with the node where you use the expression or code.
$("<node-name>").item
The linked item. This is the item in the specified node used to produce the current item. Refer to
Item linking
for more information on item linking.
$("<node-name>").params
Object containing the query settings of the given node. This includes data such as the operation it ran, result limits, and so on.
$("<node-name>").context
Boolean. Only available when working with the Loop Over Items node. Provides information about what's happening in the node. Use this to determine whether the node is still processing items.
$("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeInputIndex)
Use instead of
$("<node-name>").item
in the Code node if you need to trace back from an input item.

_("<node-name>").all(branchIndex?, runIndex?)
Returns all items from a given node. If

with the node where you use the expression or code.
_("<node-name>").first(branchIndex?, runIndex?)
The first item output by the given node. If
branchIndex
isn't given it will default to the output that connects
node-name

in the Code node if you need to trace back from an input item. Refer to
Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow
for an example.
