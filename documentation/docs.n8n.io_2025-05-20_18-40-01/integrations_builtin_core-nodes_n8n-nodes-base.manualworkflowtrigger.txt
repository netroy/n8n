Manual Trigger node
#
Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting
Test Workflow
and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.
Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the
Schedule Trigger
firing on a set schedule.
The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.
Use this trigger:
To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.
