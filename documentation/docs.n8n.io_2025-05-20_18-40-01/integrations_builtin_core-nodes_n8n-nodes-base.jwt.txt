Node parameters
#
This node can be used as an AI tool
This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the
AI tool parameters documentation
.
Credential to connect with
: Select or create a
JWT credential
to connect with.
Token
: Enter the token to
Verify
or
Decode
.
If you select the
Sign
operation, you'll also have this parameter:
Use JSON to Build Payload
: When turned on, the node uses JSON to build the claims. The selection here influences what appears in the Payload Claims section.
Payload Claims
#
The node only displays payload claims if you select the
Sign
operation. What you see depends on what you select for
Use JSON to Build Payload
:
If you select
Use JSON to Build Payload
, this section displays a JSON editor where you can construct the claims.
If you don't select
Use JSON to Build Payload
, this section prompts you to
Add Claim
.
You can add the following claims.
Audience
#
The
Audience
or
aud
claim identifies the intended recipients of the JWT.
Refer to
"aud" (Audience) Claim
for more information.
Expires In
#
The
Expires In
or
exp
claim identifies the time after which the JWT expires and must not be accepted for processing.
Refer to
"exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
for more information.
Issuer
#
The
Issuer
or
iss
claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT.
Refer to
"iss" (Issuer) Claim
for more information.
JWT ID
#
The
JWT ID
or
jti
claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT.
Refer to
"jti" (JWT ID) Claim
for more information.
Not Before
#
The
Not Before
or
nbf
claim identifies the time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
Refer to
"nbf" (Not Before) Claim
for more information.
Subject
#
The
Subject
or
sub
claim identifies the principal that's the subject of the JWT.
Refer to
"sub" (Subject) Claim
for more information.
Node options
#
Decode node options
#
The
Return Additional Info
toggle controls how much information the node returns.
When turned on, the node returns the complete decoded token with information about the header and signature. When turned off, the node only returns the payload.
Sign node options
#
Use the
Override Algorithm
control to select the algorithm to use for verifying the token. This algorithm will override the algorithm selected in the credentials.
Verify node options
#
This operation includes several node options:
Return Additional Info
: This toggle controls how much information the node returns. When turned on, the node returns the complete decoded token with information about the header and signature. When turned off, the node only returns the payload.
Ignore Expiration
: This toggle controls whether the node should ignore the token's expiration time claim (
exp
). Refer to
"exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
for more information.
Ignore Not Before Claim
: This toggle controls whether to ignore the token's not before claim (
nbf
). Refer to
"nbf" (Not Before) Claim
for more information.
Clock Tolerance
: Enter the number of seconds to tolerate when checking the
nbf
and
exp
claims. This allows you to deal with small clock differences among different servers. Refer to
"exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
for more information.
Override Algorithm
: The algorithm to use for verifying the token. This algorithm will override the algorithm selected in the credentials.
