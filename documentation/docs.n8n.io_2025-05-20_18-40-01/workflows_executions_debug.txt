Debug and re-run past executions
#
Feature availability
Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.
Load data
#
To load data from a previous execution:
In your workflow, select the
Executions
tab to view the
Executions
list.
Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
For failed executions: select
Debug in editor
.
For successful executions: select
Copy to editor
.
n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and
pins the data
in the first node in the workflow.
Check which executions you save
The executions available on the
Executions
list depends on your
Workflow settings
.
