LangChain concepts in n8n
#
This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.
This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's
Cluster nodes
.
n8n implements LangChain JS
This feature is n8n's implementation of
LangChain's JavaScript framework
.
Trigger nodes
#
Chat Trigger
Cluster nodes
#
Cluster nodes
are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a
root node
and one or more
sub-nodes
that extend the functionality of the node.
Root nodes
#
Each cluster starts with one
root node
.
Chains
#
A
chain
is a series of LLMs, and related tools, linked together to support functionality that can't be provided by a single LLM alone.
Available nodes:
Basic LLM Chain
Retrieval Q&A Chain
Summarization Chain
Sentiment Analysis
Text Classifier
Learn more about
chaining in LangChain
.
Agents
#
An
agent
has access to a suite of tools, and determines which ones to use depending on the user input. Agents can use multiple tools, and use the output of one tool as the input to the next.

.
Vector stores
#
Vector stores
store embedded data, and perform vector searches on it.
Simple Vector Store
PGVector Vector Store
Pinecone Vector Store
Qdrant Vector Store
Supabase Vector Store
Zep Vector Store
Learn more about
Vector stores in LangChain
.
Miscellaneous
#
Utility nodes.
LangChain Code
: import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.
Sub-nodes
#
Each root node can have one or more
sub-nodes
attached to it.
Document loaders
#
Document loaders add data to your chain as documents. The data source can be a file or web service.
Available nodes:
Default Document Loader
GitHub Document Loader

Document loaders in LangChain
.
Language models
#
LLMs (large language models)
are programs that analyze datasets. They're the key element of working with AI.
Available nodes:
Anthropic Chat Model
AWS Bedrock Chat Model
Cohere Model
Hugging Face Inference Model
Mistral Cloud Chat Model
Ollama Chat Model
Ollama Model
OpenAI Chat Model
Learn more about
Language models in LangChain
.
Memory
#
Memory
retains information about previous queries in a series of queries. For example, when a user interacts with a chat model, it's useful if your application can remember and call on the full conversation, not just the most recent query entered by the user.
Available nodes:
Motorhead
Redis Chat Memory
Postgres Chat Memory
Simple Memory
Xata
Zep

Memory in LangChain
.
Output parsers
#
Output parsers take the text generated by an LLM and format it to match the structure you require.
Available nodes:
Auto-fixing Output Parser
Item List Output Parser
Structured Output Parser
Learn more about
Output parsers in LangChain
.
Retrievers
#
Contextual Compression Retriever
MultiQuery Retriever
Vector Store Retriever
Workflow Retriever
Text splitters
#
Text splitters break down data (documents), making it easier for the LLM to process the information and return accurate results.
Available nodes:
Character Text Splitter
Recursive Character Text Splitter
Token Splitter
n8n's text splitter nodes implements parts of
LangChain's text_splitter API
.
