Node base file
#
The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to
Choose your node building approach
.
These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to
Build a declarative-style node
or
Build a programmatic-style node
.
You can also explore the
n8n-nodes-starter
and n8n's own
nodes
for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n
Mattermost node
is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.
For all nodes, refer to the:
Structure of the node base file
Standard parameters
For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:
Declarative-style parameters
For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:
Programmatic-style parameters
Programmatic-style execute() method
