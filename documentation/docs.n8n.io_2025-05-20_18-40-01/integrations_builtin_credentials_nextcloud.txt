Using basic auth
#
To configure this credential, you'll need a
Nextcloud
account and:
Your
Web DAV URL
Your
User
name
Your
Password
or an app password
To set it up:
To create your
Web DAV URL
: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain: Enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add
/remote.php/webdav/
. For example, if you access Nextcloud at
https://cloud.n8n.com
, your WebDAV URL is
https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav
.
If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add
/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/
. Replace
<subdirectory>
with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
Refer to Nextcloud's
Third-party WebDAV clients
documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.
Enter your
User
name.
For the
Password
, Nextcloud recommends using an app password rather than your user password. To create an app password:
In the Nextcloud Web interface, select your avatar in the top right and select
Personal settings
.
In the left menu, choose
Security
.
Scroll to the bottom to the
App Password
section and create a new app password.
Copy that app password and enter it in n8n as your
Password
.
Using OAuth2
#
To configure this credential, you'll need a
Nextcloud
account and:
An
Authorization URL
and
Access Token URL
: These depend on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.
A
Client ID
: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in
Administrator Security Settings
.
A
Client Secret
: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in
Administrator Security Settings
.
A
Web DAV URL
: This depends on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.
To set it up:
In Nextcloud, open your
Administrator Security Settings
.
Find the
Add client
section under
OAuth 2.0 clients
.
Enter a
Name
for your client, like
n8n integration
.
Copy the
OAuth Callback URL
from n8n and enter it as the
Redirection URI
.
Then select
Add
in Nextcloud.
In n8n, update the
Authorization URL
to replace
https://nextcloud.example.com
with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at
https://cloud.n8n.com
, the Authorization URL is
https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize
.
In n8n, update the
Access Token URL
to replace
https://nextcloud.example.com
with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at
https://cloud.n8n.com
, the Access Token URL is
https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token
.
Pretty URL configuration
The
Authorization URL
and
Access Token URL
assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use
Pretty URLs
. If you haven't, you must add
/index.php/
between your Nextcloud URL and the
/apps/oauth2
portion, for example:
https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token
.
Copy the Nextcloud
Client Identifier
for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the
Client ID
in n8n.
Copy the Nextcloud
Secret
and enter it as the
Client Secret
in n8n.
In n8n, to create your
Web DAV URL
: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add
/remote.php/webdav/
. For example, if you access Nextcloud at
https://cloud.n8n.com
, your WebDAV URL is
https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav
.
If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add
/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/
. Replace
<subdirectory>
with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
Refer to Nextcloud's
Third-party WebDAV clients
documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.
