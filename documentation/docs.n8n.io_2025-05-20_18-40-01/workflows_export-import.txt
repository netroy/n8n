Export and import workflows
#
n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. 
You can export and import workflows in several ways.
Sharing credentials
Exported workflow JSON files include
credential
names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.
Copy-Paste
#
You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard (
Ctrl + c
or
cmd +c
) and pasting it (
Ctrl + v
or
cmd + v
) into the Editor UI.
To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag:
From the Editor UI menu
#
From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right
to see the following options:
