OpenAI Audio operations
#
Use this operation to generate an audio, or transcribe or translate a recording in OpenAI. Refer to
OpenAI
for more information on the OpenAI node itself.
Generate Audio
#
Use this operation to create audio from a text prompt.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with
: Create or select an existing
OpenAI credential
.
Resource
: Select
Audio
.
Operation
: Select
Generate Audio
.
Model
: Select the model you want to use to generate the audio. Refer to
TTS | OpenAI
for more information.
TTS-1
: Use this to optimize for speed.
TTS-1-HD
: Use this to optimize for quality.
Text Input
: Enter the text to generate the audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.
Voice
: Select a voice to use when generating the audio. Listen to the previews of the voices in
Text to speech guide | OpenAI
.
Options
#
Response Format
: Select the format for the audio response. Choose from
MP3
(default),
OPUS
,
AAC
,
FLAC
,
WAV
, and
PCM
.
Audio Speed
: Enter the speed for the generated audio from a value from
0.25
to
4.0
. Defaults to
1
.
Put Output in Field
: Defaults to
data
. Enter the name of the output field to put the binary file data in.
Refer to
Create speech | OpenAI
documentation for more information.
Transcribe a Recording
#
Use this operation to transcribe audio into text. OpenAI API limits the size of the audio file to 25 MB. OpenAI will use the
whisper-1
model by default.
Enter these parameters:
Credential to connect with
: Create or select an existing
OpenAI credential
.
Resource
: Select
Audio
.
Operation
: Select
Transcribe a Recording
.
Input Data Field Name
: Defaults to
data
. Enter the name of the binary property that contains the audio file in one of these formats:
.flac
,
.mp3
,
.mp4
,
.mpeg
,
.mpga
,
.m4a
,
.ogg
,
.wav
, or
.webm
.
Options
#
Language of the Audio File
: Enter the language of the input audio in
ISO-639-1
. Use this option to improve accuracy and latency.
Output Randomness (Temperature)
: Defaults to
1.0
. Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between
0.0
(deterministic) and
1.0
(maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or
Output Randomness (Top P)
but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it.

Create transcription | OpenAI
documentation for more information.
Translate a Recording
#
Use this operation to translate audio into English. OpenAI API limits the size of the audio file to 25 MB. OpenAI will use the
