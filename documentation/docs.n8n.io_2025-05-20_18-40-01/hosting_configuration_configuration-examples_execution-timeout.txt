Configure workflow timeout settings
#
A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT
default is
-1
. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:
1
export
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT
=
3600
You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:
1
export
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX
=
7200
