For each competitor, include the **Name**, a **Reason** summarizing why they are using or considering the competitor, a **Known** boolean field indicating if the competitor is part of a provided known list, and a **Pricing** field to capture any pricing details mentioned. **Details for Each Category**:\n\n- **Used**: List competitors that the external speaker has previously used. Include details about the purpose or reason for using these competitors, such as \"better integrations,\" \"better support,\" or \"specific features.\"\n- **Considering**: List competitors the external speaker is currently evaluating as alternatives to n8n. Include any details provided about why these competitors are being considered, such as \"scalability,\" \"cost-effectiveness,\" or \"existing familiarity.\"\n- **Known Competitor List**: Reference the following known list to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with transcription issues or unusual company names: {{ $json.metaData.Competitors }} Only include a competitor if language is used to that suggests that they are comparing the competitor to n8n or language is used that suggests that it is a better match than n8n or being evaluated against n8n. \n- - If a competitor matches one from the known list, set **Known** to `true` and output the name exactly as it is in the list above. If it is not on the list, set **Known** to `false` and output the company name as output. If they do not mention the name of the competitor but allude to one, output the name \"Unknown\" as the name of the compeitor. \n- **Pricing**: Capture any pricing information mentioned about the competitor. This may include specific price points, subscription plans, or cost comparisons. If no pricing information is found, set **Pricing** to `null`.\n- **Sentiment**: Capture the sentiment of the external speaker towards the competitor using one of three options, \"n8n better\",\"n8n worse\", \"Unknown\". Include the reason for choosing sentiment in \"Reason\" with quotes from transcript or if not reasoning for choosing that sentiment. \"n8n better\" should be used where language is used to denote that they find n8n's features better than the competitor. \"n8n worse\" should be used where language is used to denote that they find the competitors features better equipped to handle their use case. Use \"Unknown\" if they do not have sentiment one way or another regarding the competitor.   \n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Competitors\": [\n    {\n      \"Tag\": \"Used or Considering\",\n      \"Name\": \"Competitor Name\",\n      \"Reason\": \"Reason for using or considering this competitor.\",\n      \"Known\": true,\n      \"Pricing\": \"Pricing details or null if not mentioned.\",\n      \"Sentiment\": \"n8n better, n8n worse, or Unknown\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback** (If no competitors mentioned):  \n```json\n{\n  \"Competitors\": []\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **7. Integrations**\n**Prompt**:  \nList any software the external speaker mentions they either currently use or want to integrate with n8n, along with the context or reason for the integration if specified. Do not comma separate the integration names, and simplify just to the name of the integration. Focus on specific integrations named on the call and avoid general or vague terms. Reference the provided comma separated list of native nodes from our database to determine if the integration is natively supported. List of current Integrations: {{ $json.metaData.Integrations }}. Only include an integration if language is used to that suggests that they are trying to deploy or integrate with n8n or have in the past. Do not use general terms for integrations, please use company names. Include tags for the integration status and usage status. Transcription Analysis Tip: If the external speaker mentions they are currently using an integration through the HTTP request node but express a desire for a dedicated node, classify the IntegrationStatus as \"Not Integrated\" and the UsageStatus as \"Currently Using.\" This indicates that they are using a workaround and would prefer native support.\n\n- Explanation of Fields\n- - **IntegrationName**: The simplified name of the software mentioned. If the Integration is in the comma separated list above, use the exact name in the comma separated list as the IntegrationName.\n- - **SummaryOfUse**: A brief description of how the external speaker wants to use or integrate the software with n8n, including mention of using the **HTTP request node** if applicable.\n- - **IntegrationStatus**: Use \"Currently Integrated\" if the integration is natively supported by n8n by checking the comma separated List of current Integrations above, and \"Not Integrated\" if it is not in the list above. \n- - **UsageStatus**: Use \"Currently Using\" if the external speaker is actively using the integration (including via the HTTP request node), and \"Want to Use\" if they are only considering or planning to use it.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Integrations\": [\n    {\n      \"IntegrationName\": \"Integration Name\",\n      \"SummaryOfUse\": \"Brief description of the integration use case.\",\n      \"IntegrationStatus\": \"Currently Integrated or Not Integrated\",\n      \"UsageStatus\": \"Currently Using or Want to Use\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback** (If no integrations mentioned):  \n```json\n{\n  \"Integrations\": []\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **8. Sentiment**\n**Prompt**:  \nDetermine the overall sentiment of the external speaker throughout the call. It should be categorized as one of \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative\" based on their feedback, objections, and tone. \n- **Positive**: The external speaker shows genuine interest in the n8n platform, discusses clear and actionable next steps, or uses enthusiastic language. Look for phrases that indicate excitement or satisfaction, such as \"this is great,\" \"we're looking forward to,\" or \"this could really help us.\" \n- **Neutral**: The external speaker neither expresses strong enthusiasm nor significant concerns. They may use language that indicates a wait-and-see approach, such as \"let's explore this further\" or \"we need more information.\" The call may end with some uncertainty, but without outright dismissal and with specific plans to meet again. \n- **Negative**: The external speaker expresses significant concerns or reluctance about using n8n. Indicators include phrases like \"not a fit,\" \"not a fit right now,\" or discussion about taking the information away and \"following up if we need more information in the future/down the line.\" Negative sentiment can also be inferred if the call ends without any clear next steps.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Positive, Neutral, or Negative\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"Sentiment\": \"Neutral\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **9. CurrentSituation**\n**Prompt**:  \nSummarize the external speaker's current situation and why they need automation. Focus on specific pain points, inefficiencies, or challenges they are trying to solve with automation. Look for statements that describe existing n8n workflows, tools, or bottlenecks.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"CurrentSituation\": \"Reason why n8n automation is needed.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"CurrentSituation\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **10. Budget**\n**Prompt**:  \nIdentify the external speaker's budget for this opportunity, if mentioned. Include specific amounts, ranges, or qualitative statements about their willingness or ability to invest.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Budget\": \"Brief summary of budget including specific amounts, ranges, or qualitative statements about their willingness or ability to invest\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"Budget\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **11. Authority**\n**Prompt**:  \nDetermine who the decision-making authority is for purchasing the solution. Look for titles, departments, or references to the individual(s) responsible for approving the purchase. \n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Authority\": \"Summary of the decision-making authority in charge of purchasing the n8n platform\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"Authority\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **12. Timeline**\n**Prompt**:  \nIdentify the timeline for purchasing the solution. Include deadlines, dates, or key events that indicate the urgency or planned timeframe for the decision.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"Timeline\": \"Brief summary of the timeline for purchasing the n8n platform\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback if unable to determine timeline**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"Timeline\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **13. DecisionProcess**\n**Prompt**:  \nSummarize the process the organization follows to make purchasing decisions. Look for references to steps such as internal evaluations, stakeholder approvals, or pilot testing.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"DecisionProcess\": \"Summary of the Decisons Process to make the purchasing decison of the n8n platform\"\n}\n```\n\n**Fallback**:  \n```json\n{\n  \"DecisionProcess\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n---"
